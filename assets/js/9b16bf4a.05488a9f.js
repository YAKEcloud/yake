Of course, open source is a great and resulted in many popular and useful software packages. However, open source software is often confused with free of charge software. From this perspective, it is mandatory to find customers before open sourcing the solution. Consequently, our approach does not include an open source strategy at the moment without sacrificing that our customers stay independent."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:o}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return o?(0,r.jsx)(o,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
