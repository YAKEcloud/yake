This new feature allows users to configure the retention period for delta snapshots in the ETCD component. By making the delta snapshot retention period configurable, we provide a more flexible debugging experience. Delta snapshots can now be retained for a user-defined duration, offering a valuable window for reviewing changes in case of any issues.  by @seshachalam-yv ","[#8659]"),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"[OPERATOR]")," Enabled the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"node-exporter"),"'s  ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector"},"textfile collector"),".
