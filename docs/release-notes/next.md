## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` The Shoot resource does now support configuring the global maximum allowed resources the vpa-recommender can recommend for a container. The corresponding upstream configuration option solves a known limitation of vpa-recommender where it can make a Pod unschedulable by recommending resource requests more than largest Node's allocatable. For more details, see [Specifying global maximum allowed resources to prevent pods from being unschedulable](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/docs/examples.md#specifying-global-maximum-allowed-resources-to-prevent-pods-from-being-unschedulable). by @ialidzhikov [#12481]

- `[USER]` The Kubernetes feature gate `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` is now marked as removed in Kubernetes 1.32. Previously, it was possible to upgrade a Shoot cluster to Kubernetes 1.32 with this feature gate enabled, which resulted in kube-apiserver failing to start due to an unrecognized feature gate. by @marc1404 [#12643]
