# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEVELOPER]` The following mapper funcs from the extension library no longer accept a `context.Context` arg - `ClusterToContainerResourceMapper`, `ClusterToControlPlaneMapper`, `ClusterToDNSRecordMapper`, `ClusterToExtensionMapper`, `ClusterToInfrastructureMapper`, `ClusterToNetworkMapper`, `ClusterToWorkerMapper` and `ClusterToObjectMapper`. The `context.Context` arg was redundant and not used. by @acumino [#8321]
- `[USER]` Deprecated annotation `alpha.featuregates.shoot.gardener.cloud/node-local-dns` is removed. Use field `.spec.systemComponents.nodeLocalDNS.enabled` in `Shoot` instead. Switching on node-local-dns via shoot specification will roll the nodes even if node-local-dns was enabled beforehand via annotation. by @acumino [#8364]
- `[USER]` Deprecated annotation `alpha.featuregates.shoot.gardener.cloud/node-local-dns-force-tcp-to-{cluster-dns, upstream-dns}` is removed. Use field `.spec.systemComponents.nodeLocalDNS.{forceTCPToClusterDNS, forceTCPToUpstreamDNS}` in `Shoot` instead. by @acumino [#8364]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` `kubectl get garden` now features additional printer column `Observability` providing information about the Observability components of the runtime cluster. by @gardener-ci-robot [#8384]
- `[OPERATOR]` It is possible now to trigger a seed reconciliation by annotating the Seed with `gardener.cloud/operation=reconcile`. by @shafeeqes [#8347]
- `[OPERATOR]` Status of `garden` now includes the `ObservabilityComponentsHealthy` condition which show the health of observability components in the garden runtime-cluster. by @oliver-goetz [#8346]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` `operator` now deletes `ManagedResources` deployed to the virtual-garden before deleting `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver`. by @oliver-goetz [#8368]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug is fixed that prevented scraping the metrics of etcd in the shoot control plane. by @istvanballok [#8371]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug is fixed that rendered the "CPU usage" panel of the "VPN" Plutono dashboard blank. by @gardener-ci-robot [#8392]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug is fixed in the Prometheus alert definitions that caused false positive KubePodNotReadyControlPlane alerts related to the etcd compaction job. by @rickardsjp [#8361]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Shoot node network and seed pod network need to be disjoint. This will be checked during scheduling of a shoot cluster, i.e. during initial admission or on control-plane migration. by @ScheererJ [#8353]
- `[OPERATOR]` Prometheus scrape job configs for targets in the shoot cluster have been improved. by @rickardsjp [#8360]
- `[OPERATOR]` The following images are updated:  
  - registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server: v0.6.3 -> v0.6.4  
  - registry.k8s.io/cpa/cluster-proportional-autoscaler: v1.8.8 -> v1.8.9
