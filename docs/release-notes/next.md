# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` `kubeletCSRApprover` controller in `gardener-resource-manager` Helm chart has been renamed to `csrApprover`. by @oliver-goetz [#10549]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `HVPA` and `HVPAForShootedSeed` feature gates have been deprecated and locked to false. Disable the `HVPA` and `HVPAForShootedSeed` feature gates if you have them enabled before upgrading to this version of Gardener. by @plkokanov [#10659]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[USER]` For Kubernetes 1.31+ Shoot clusters, the kubelet and containerd cgroup driver is set to `systemd`. Previously, the used cgroup driver was `cgroupfs`. Find more details in the [cgroup driver section](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.105.0/docs/extensions/operatingsystemconfig.md#cgroup-driver). by @ialidzhikov [#10472]
- `[OPERATOR]` The gardener operator chart (`charts/gardener/operator`) does no longer enable the `HVPA` feature gate in its default `values.yaml`. by @ialidzhikov [#10566]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` Allow gosec to be consumed from gardener/gardener by @ScheererJ [#10642]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.31. Extension developers have to prepare individual extensions as well to work with 1.31. by @ialidzhikov [#10472]
- `[OPERATOR]` Adds `CloudProfile` validation for the recently introduced `.spec.bastion` section. by @hebelsan [#10318]
- `[OPERATOR]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.31. To allow creation/update of 1.31 clusters you will have to update the version of your provider extension(s) to a version that supports 1.31 as well. Please consult the respective releases and notes in the provider extension's repository. by @ialidzhikov [#10472]
- `[OPERATOR]` Added an alert for the `Garden` resource's conditions, along with a dashboard that also displays the resource's last operation. by @rickardsjp [#10562]
