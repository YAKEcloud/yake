# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` There is an incompatible change in the `Garden` (`gardens.operator.gardener.cloud`) custom resource: Fields `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.{nodes,pods,services}` and `.spec.virtualCluster.networking.services` were changed from type `string` to type `[]string`, e.g., in JSON format, replace `"nodes": "10.0.0.0/16"` with `"nodes": ["10.0.0.0/16"]`. by @ScheererJ [#11251]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` Incoming reverse VPN connections no longer get authenticated by the reversed-vpn-auth-server as the authentication logic was moved to envoy itself. by @Wieneo [#11328]
- `[OPERATOR]` The apiserver-proxy component does not use the proxy protocol anymore, see [GEP-30](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/30-apiserver-proxy.md). by @Wieneo [#11364]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `shoot.gardener.cloud/managed-seed-api-server` annotation is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead, consider enabling high availability for the ManagedSeed's Shoot control plane. by @ialidzhikov [#11372]
- `[OPERATOR]` Added a new feature gate called "RemoveAPIServerProxyLegacyPort", which disables the unused proxy port (8443) on the istio-ingressgateway Services. Operators can choose to remove the legacy apiserver-proxy port as soon as all shoots have switched to the new apiserver-proxy configuration. They might want to do so if they activate the ACL extension, which is vulnerable to proxy protocol headers of untrusted clients on the apiserver-proxy port. by @Wieneo [#11380]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` `gardener-operator` maintains information about Gardener API Server configuration in the world readable `ConfigMap` `gardener-info` in the `gardener-system-public` `Namespace`, read [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/gardener/gardener_info_configmap.md) for more details about the content of the`ConfigMap`.  by @vpnachev [#11238]
- `[OPERATOR]` Enhance the `gardener-operator` to allow specification of more than a single network range for `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.nodes`, `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.pods`, `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.services`, and `.spec.virtualCluster.networking.services`, which also allows dual-stack configurations. by @ScheererJ [#11251]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduces `shoot_operation_duration_seconds` metric to record `Shoot` operation `Create` and `Delete`.  by @simcod [#10971]
- `[OPERATOR]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.32. To allow creation/update of 1.32 clusters you will have to update the version of your provider extension(s) to a version that supports 1.32 as well. Please consult the respective releases and notes in the provider extension's repository. by @marc1404 [#11197]
- `[OPERATOR]` `CloudProfile.spec.limits.maxNodesTotal` can be used to limit the maximum number of nodes a shoot can have during runtime. See [the documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot/shoot_limits.md) for more details. by @timebertt [#11279]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.32. Extension developers have to prepare individual extensions as well to work with 1.32. by @marc1404 [#11197]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug which prevented usage of labels with `seed.gardener.cloud/` prefix on `Seed`, `ManagedSeed`, `BackupEntry`, and `Shoot` resources has been fixed. by @rfranzke [#11485]
- `[OPERATOR]` A misleading error message appearing when an operator has wrongly configured OIDC config for the Gardener Dashboard in the Garden resource was fixed. by @dimityrmirchev [#11432]
- `[USER]` The ETCD encryption config now properly configures a 32-byte key. by @dimityrmirchev [#11150]
