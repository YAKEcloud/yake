# [gardener/gardener]

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent` now converts the hostname to lower case to match `kubelet` behaviour when it maintains the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label on `Node`s. by @rfranzke [#8903]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent` now skips disablement and stop attempts of deleted units in case their unit files have already been cleaned up by third parties. by @rfranzke [#8900]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent` now creates temporary directories and files under `/var/lib/gardener-node-agent/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. This fixes issues during `OperatingSystemConfig` reconciliation which occur when `/var` and `/tmp` are backed by different file systems or devices. by @rfranzke [#8895]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent`'s `OperatingSystemConfig` controller now respects the reconciliation timeout and aborts the reconciliation if it takes too long. by @rfranzke [#8908]
- `[DEPENDENCY]` extension library: An issue causing the Worker restore operation to fail for hibernated Shoots is now fixed. by @ialidzhikov [#8949]
## üèÉ Others
