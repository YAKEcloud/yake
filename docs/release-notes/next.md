## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` The admission webhook now validates `CredentialsBinding`s. by @dimityrmirchev [#1047]

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` An issue causing Shoot force deletion to fail because the control plane webhook failing to get the Infrastructure object from the Seed cluster is now fixed. The control plane webhook now reads the infrastructureConfig from the Shoot spec in the Cluster resource. Previously, it was fetching the Infrastructure object from the Seed cluster and was reading the infrastructureConfig from there. by @Kostov6 [#1068]

- `[OPERATOR]` The aws-ipam-controller is enabled for IPv6 and dual stack shoot clusters. It replaces the IPAM of the cloud-controller-manager and kube-controller-manager and supports additionally prefix delegation in case of IPv6 or dual stack.  by @DockToFuture [#984]
- `[OPERATOR]` Add ipv6 support to deploy IPv6 shoots. by @axel7born [#1024]

- `[OPERATOR]` A new api object `rsyslog-relp.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Auditd` is introduced which is used to specify a configuration for the linux audit daemon on the shoot nodes. by @plkokanov [#149]
- `[OPERATOR]` Helm charts of extension and admission controller are published as OCI artifacts now. by @oliver-goetz [#147]

  - `.auditConfig.configMapReferenceName` is a reference to a `ConfigMap` shoot resource which contains audit configuration. This field is only taken into account if `.auditRulesConfig.enabled` is `true`. The `ConfigMap` must contain a data key `auditd` which must contain a value of type `rsyslog-relp.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Auditd`. by @plkokanov [#149]
