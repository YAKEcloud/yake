<summary><b>Update gardener-controlplane to <code>1.72.0</code></b></summary>

# [gardener]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* The `core/v1alpha1` API version is dropped. ([gardener/gardener#7965](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7965), [@ary1992](https://github.com/ary1992))
* *[USER]* The `alpha.featuregates.shoot.gardener.cloud/apiserver-sni-pod-injector` annotation has been dropped and is no longer available for `Shoot`s. It should be removed from all existing `Shoot` resources. ([gardener/gardener#7980](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7980), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[USER]* Any resource with a kind other than `ConfigMap` or `Secret` in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s is now forcefully removed. New validation has been introduced to prevent adding other resources in the future. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[USER]* Webhooks remediator now sets the timeoutSeonds to 3 seconds for webhook affecting lease resources in `kube-system` namespace. ([gardener/gardener#7902](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7902), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* ‚ö†Ô∏è Seeds' `.spec.settings.ownerChecks.enabled` field is locked to `false` (i.e. if the field value is true a validation error will be returned). Before updating to this version of Gardener, set `.spec.settings.ownerChecks.enabled` field to `false` for you Seeds and ManagedSeeds. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
* *[OPERATOR]* It is required to have `ControllerRegistrations`s for Kinds `ControlPlane`, `Infrastructure` and `Worker` with the same types used for seeds (`seed.spec.provider.type`). This is already the case if seeds and shoots share the same cloud provider. The seed reconciliation flow waits for the associated `ControllerInstallation` to be ready before continuing rolling out seed system components. It allows Gardener provider extensions to ship components that not only act on shoot control-plane but also on seed system components. ([gardener/gardener#7928](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7928), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The `{github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/helper,github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/helper}.SeedSettingOwnerChecksEnabled` will now return `false` if the corresponding Seed setting is `nil`. Previously, the func was returning `true` when the Seed setting is `nil`. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The unused `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/controllerutils/predicate.IsBeingMigratedPredicate`, `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/controllerutils/predicate.IsObjectBeingMigrated` and `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/utils/gardener.IsObjectBeingMigrated` funcs are now removed. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[USER]* The certificate chains served by `kube-apiserver`s does now include the CA certificates used to sign their server certificates. ([gardener/gardener#7961](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7961), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[OPERATOR]* `gardener-operator` configures SNI components in order to expose the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` via the `istio-ingressgateway` in the Garden cluster. ([gardener/gardener#7953](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7953), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
  * With this change, operators can start to switch DNS records from the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` service to the `istio-ingress` service endpoint. The type of the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` service will soon be switched from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP`.
* *[DEVELOPER]* When performing control plane migration with `provider-local`, the full migration and restoration logic implemented in the extensions library (generic `Worker` actuator) is now executed (previously, it was skipped). This improves the accuracy of the e2e tests for control plane migration. ([gardener/gardener#7981](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7981), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[USER]* A bug that prevented referencing `ConfigMap`s in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s has been fixed. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[USER]* A bug that prevented finalizers from being added to referenced `Secret`s or `ConfigMap`s in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s has been fixed. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `NetworkPolicy` reconciler is only added to `gardener-operator` if the `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.{pods,services}` fields of the `Garden` are set. ([gardener/gardener#7983](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7983), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* Several low timeouts (30s) that were introduced in v1.71.0 for several steps are now reverted as in some cases the Network/ControlPlane reconciliation cannot succeed for 30s. ([gardener/gardener#8005](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8005), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
## üèÉ Others

<summary><b>Update gardenlet to <code>1.72.0</code></b></summary>

# [gardener]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* The `core/v1alpha1` API version is dropped. ([gardener/gardener#7965](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7965), [@ary1992](https://github.com/ary1992))
* *[USER]* The `alpha.featuregates.shoot.gardener.cloud/apiserver-sni-pod-injector` annotation has been dropped and is no longer available for `Shoot`s. It should be removed from all existing `Shoot` resources. ([gardener/gardener#7980](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7980), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[USER]* Any resource with a kind other than `ConfigMap` or `Secret` in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s is now forcefully removed. New validation has been introduced to prevent adding other resources in the future. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[USER]* Webhooks remediator now sets the timeoutSeonds to 3 seconds for webhook affecting lease resources in `kube-system` namespace. ([gardener/gardener#7902](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7902), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* ‚ö†Ô∏è Seeds' `.spec.settings.ownerChecks.enabled` field is locked to `false` (i.e. if the field value is true a validation error will be returned). Before updating to this version of Gardener, set `.spec.settings.ownerChecks.enabled` field to `false` for you Seeds and ManagedSeeds. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
* *[OPERATOR]* It is required to have `ControllerRegistrations`s for Kinds `ControlPlane`, `Infrastructure` and `Worker` with the same types used for seeds (`seed.spec.provider.type`). This is already the case if seeds and shoots share the same cloud provider. The seed reconciliation flow waits for the associated `ControllerInstallation` to be ready before continuing rolling out seed system components. It allows Gardener provider extensions to ship components that not only act on shoot control-plane but also on seed system components. ([gardener/gardener#7928](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7928), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The `{github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/helper,github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/helper}.SeedSettingOwnerChecksEnabled` will now return `false` if the corresponding Seed setting is `nil`. Previously, the func was returning `true` when the Seed setting is `nil`. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The unused `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/controllerutils/predicate.IsBeingMigratedPredicate`, `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/controllerutils/predicate.IsObjectBeingMigrated` and `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/utils/gardener.IsObjectBeingMigrated` funcs are now removed. ([gardener/gardener#7909](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7909), [@dimitar-kostadinov](https://github.com/dimitar-kostadinov))
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[USER]* The certificate chains served by `kube-apiserver`s does now include the CA certificates used to sign their server certificates. ([gardener/gardener#7961](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7961), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[OPERATOR]* `gardener-operator` configures SNI components in order to expose the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` via the `istio-ingressgateway` in the Garden cluster. ([gardener/gardener#7953](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7953), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
  * With this change, operators can start to switch DNS records from the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` service to the `istio-ingress` service endpoint. The type of the `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver` service will soon be switched from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP`.
* *[DEVELOPER]* When performing control plane migration with `provider-local`, the full migration and restoration logic implemented in the extensions library (generic `Worker` actuator) is now executed (previously, it was skipped). This improves the accuracy of the e2e tests for control plane migration. ([gardener/gardener#7981](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7981), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[USER]* A bug that prevented referencing `ConfigMap`s in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s has been fixed. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[USER]* A bug that prevented finalizers from being added to referenced `Secret`s or `ConfigMap`s in `.spec.resources` in `Shoot`s has been fixed. ([gardener/gardener#7995](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7995), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `NetworkPolicy` reconciler is only added to `gardener-operator` if the `.spec.runtimeCluster.networking.{pods,services}` fields of the `Garden` are set. ([gardener/gardener#7983](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7983), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* Several low timeouts (30s) that were introduced in v1.71.0 for several steps are now reverted as in some cases the Network/ControlPlane reconciliation cannot succeed for 30s. ([gardener/gardener#8005](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8005), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
## üèÉ Others
* *[OPERATOR]* A configuration issue that resulted in a relatively slow startup and termination of the vali pods is fixed. ([gardener/gardener#7979](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7979), [@istvanballok](https://github.com/istvanballok))
* *[OPERATOR]* Add new grafana dashboard of seed deployment replicas ([gardener/gardener#7896](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7896), [@Sallyan](https://github.com/Sallyan))

## üèÉ Others
* *[OPERATOR]* More categories are added to label a release note for a PR on DWD. ([gardener/dependency-watchdog#75](https://github.com/gardener/dependency-watchdog/pull/75), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
  * Release notifications would now be sent to `gardener-dwd` channel (private) on releases.
* *[OPERATOR]* Probes will not be created for shoots with no workers. ([gardener/dependency-watchdog#82](https://github.com/gardener/dependency-watchdog/pull/82), [@unmarshall](https://github.com/unmarshall))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixes for `make check` target ([gardener/dependency-watchdog#87](https://github.com/gardener/dependency-watchdog/pull/87), [@unmarshall](https://github.com/unmarshall))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* Following dependencies are updated: ([gardener/dependency-watchdog#84](https://github.com/gardener/dependency-watchdog/pull/84), [@unmarshall](https://github.com/unmarshall))

* *[OPERATOR]* Added a safety check before adding a learner(non-voting) member in etcd cluster. ([gardener/etcd-backup-restore#605](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/pull/605), [@ishan16696](https://github.com/ishan16696))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Upgrade to go 1.20.3 ([gardener/etcd-backup-restore#613](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/pull/613), [@shreyas-s-rao](https://github.com/shreyas-s-rao))
