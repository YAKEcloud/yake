# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` The `VPAForETCD` feature gate is promoted to beta and now enabled by default. by @voelzmo [#9873]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `CoreDNSQueryRewriting` feature gate has been promoted to GA. It was already enabled by default and can now no longer be turned off. The feature gate will be removed in a future release. by @ScheererJ [#9889]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `MutableShootSpecNetworkingNodes` feature gate has been promoted to GA. It was already enabled by default and can now no longer be turned off. The feature gate will be removed in a future release. by @ScheererJ [#9890]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The deprecated fields `.spec.{reloadConfigFilePath,command}` and `.status.{units,files}` have been removed from the `extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.OperatingSystemConfig` API. by @rfranzke [#9885]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[DEVELOPER]` gardenlet now creates a secret called `worker-pools-operatingsystemconfig-hashes` in the shoot namespace on seed clusters. This secret will be used to upgrade the operating system config key calculation in the future. by @MichaelEischer [#9846]
- `[DEPENDENCY]` The "list `MachineDeployment`s" call in the generic `Worker` actuator has been moved right before its first usage to prevent that the list is outdated before it's used. by @rfranzke [#9925]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` The Kubelet configuration was enhanced to add configured worker taints during node registration. Earlier, only the `machine-controller-manager` was responsible to add taints to the `Node`s which happened asynchronously, so that unwanted workload might have already scheduled to these workers. by @timuthy [#9872]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenlet` is now capable of keeping itself updated by pulling configuration and deployment values from the garden cluster. This way, regular manual Helm deployments can be avoided. Read all about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/deployment/deploy_gardenlet_manually.md#self-upgrades).  
  Please note, a Gardenlet Helm chart is required on an OCI repository. Gardener will provide this officially in a future release. by @rfranzke [#9874]
- `[DEVELOPER]` `gardener-operator` local development setup supports creating seeds, shoots and managed-seeds now. Please see [the docs](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/deployment/getting_started_locally.md#alternative-way-to-set-up-garden-and-seed-leveraging-gardener-operator) for details. by @oliver-goetz [#9763]

- `[DEPENDENCY]` The `quay.io/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy` image has been updated to `v0.18.0`. by @gardener-ci-robot [#9917]
- `[OPERATOR]` The auto-scaling by VPA is now disabled for the `conntrack-fix` sidecar container of kube-proxy. The corresponding container does not need vertical auto-scaling. by @ialidzhikov [#9953]
## üìñ Documentation
