- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue where the `extension-shoot-rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` ManagedResource could block Shoot deletion if the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` was disabled before the Shoot deletion was triggered, and disabling the extension failed while trying to deploy the said ManagedResource and wait for it to become ready.  by @plkokanov [#80]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Bumped `github.com/gardener/gardener` to `v1.89.0.` by @plkokanov [#73]

- `[DEVELOPER]` The `vendor` directory was removed in favor of the `go mod cache`. by @timuthy [#57]
