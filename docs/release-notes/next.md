## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` ‚ö†Ô∏è The `BackupBucket` API field `spec.secretRef` has been removed, please migrate your backupbucket manifests to `spec.credentialsRef`! Gardener API server already has defaulted this field.  by @vpnachev [#12517]
- `[USER]` Starting with Kubernetes v1.34, setting the field `.spec.cloudProfileName` is be forbidden. The field will be dropped from existing Shoots once. Users are advised to drop this field and specify the cloud profile using the `.spec.cloudProfile.name` field instead. by @LucaBernstein [#11816]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` The graduated feature gate `NodeAgentAuthorizer` has been removed. by @oliver-goetz [#12576]
- `[USER]` Starting with Kubernetes v1.33, there are be API warnings for Shoots that have the `.spec.cloudProfileName` field set. Users are advised to drop this field and specify the cloud profile using the `.spec.cloudProfile.name` field instead. by @LucaBernstein [#11816]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` IPv4 or dual-stack shoots can now define IPv4 pod, service and node networks overlapping with networks of their seed. This works for both HA and non-HA shoots now. by @domdom82 [#12204]
- `[USER]` The Shoot resource does now support configuring feature gates for the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). With this feature, end users can enable the `InPlacePodVerticalScaling` feature gate of VPA. For more details, see [In-Place Updates of Pod Resources](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.124.0/docs/usage/autoscaling/in-place-resource-updates.md). by @vitanovs [#12339]
- `[OPERATOR]` Istio service & workload dashboards are deployed now in Seeds and in Garden runtime cluster to improve observability when L7 load balancing is active. Additionally, the existing Istio dashboards for Seeds are now deployed in the Garden runtime cluster too. by @oliver-goetz [#12509]
- `[OPERATOR]` The Seed and Garden resources do now support configuring feature gates for the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). With this feature, Gardener operators can enable the `InPlacePodVerticalScaling` feature gate of VPA. For more details, see [In-Place Updates of Pod Resources](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.124.0/docs/usage/autoscaling/in-place-resource-updates.md). by @vitanovs [#12339]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduced a feature gate `OpenTelemetryCollector` that enables the creation of an `OpenTelemetry Collector` inside the control-plane of every Shoot. This will route logs through the aforementioned `Collector`, enabling Shoot logs to be stored in any backend. by @rrhubenov [#12428]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in which `gardener-node-agent` was not able to in-place update OS versions that specify only `MAJOR.MINOR` in the `os-release` but `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in the cloud profile is now fixed. by @shafeeqes [#12542]

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug where WorkloadIdentity tokens used for etcd backups, i.e. in the context of `BackupEntry` resource, tried to include shoot and project info when the shoot resource is deleted is now fixed.  by @vpnachev [#12516]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-resource-manager` is now excluded from `pod-kube-apiserver-load-balancing` webhook when running in garden runtime cluster. by @oliver-goetz [#12526]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in shoot reconciliation that caused RewriteEncryptedDataAddLabel to be called for hibernated shoots, leading to a panic in the gardenlet, has been fixed. by @acumino [#12602]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in the `istio-ingress` helm chart which could lead to a missing traffic distribution policy in the internal istio-ingressgateway service on certain Kubernetes versions has been fixed. by @oliver-goetz [#12541]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug has been fixed which prevented the seed-specific Plutono dashboards from being provided by `gardenlet` in case its seed cluster was the garden runtime cluster at the same time. by @rfranzke [#12476]

# [gardener/etcd-druid]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` The existing CLI flag reconciler-service-account was optional. Its value is a fully qualified name of the service account used by etcd-druid in the format "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account-name>".  This has now been made required. If you are continuing to use the deprecated CLI fags then you must specify it. Alternatively if you have switched to using the new OperatorConfiguration then you should set "OperatorConfiguration.Webhooks.EtcdComponentProtection.ServiceAccountInfo" instead. by @unmarshall [#1090]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` The new `.spec.etcd.wrapperPort` field allows to change the server port of `etcd-wrapper`. by @rfranzke [#1086]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduced OperatorConfiguration as a replacement to the existing etcd-druid CLI flags. The configuration gets mounted as a ConfigMap onto the etcd-druid Deployment. The existing CLI flags have been marked as deprecated. Their support will be removed after a few releases of etcd-druid. by @unmarshall [#1090]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

# [gardener/etcd-druid]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` The existing CLI flag reconciler-service-account was optional. Its value is a fully qualified name of the service account used by etcd-druid in the format "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account-name>".  This has now been made required. If you are continuing to use the deprecated CLI fags then you must specify it. Alternatively if you have switched to using the new OperatorConfiguration then you should set "OperatorConfiguration.Webhooks.EtcdComponentProtection.ServiceAccountInfo" instead. by @unmarshall [#1090]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` The new `.spec.etcd.wrapperPort` field allows to change the server port of `etcd-wrapper`. by @rfranzke [#1086]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduced OperatorConfiguration as a replacement to the existing etcd-druid CLI flags. The configuration gets mounted as a ConfigMap onto the etcd-druid Deployment. The existing CLI flags have been marked as deprecated. Their support will be removed after a few releases of etcd-druid. by @unmarshall [#1090]
