## 23KE Changes and Upgrade Path

This release requires some manual interaction if you are upgrading from a previous 23KE release:
1. the dashboard-configuration values got a new root-node named "global" so if your config looked like this before:
```
frontendConfig:
  ...
bootstrap:
  ...
```
you have to change it to:
```
global:
  frontendConfig:
	...
  bootstrap:
	...
```
2. in contrast, gardenlet lost its root-node global.gardenlet and the leafs below moved to the root, if your config looked like this before:
```
global:
  gardenlet:
	config:
	  ...
```
you have to change it to:
```
config:
  ...
```
In order to change the config files please follow this steps:

Disable gardenlet and dashboard reconciliations
```
flux suspend helmrelease internal-gardenlet
flux suspend helmrelease dashboard
```
Now edit your dashboard-values and your gardenlet-values secret in your git repository and wait for reconciliation.

The dashboard has switched its helm-release name so a series of annotations is necessary:
```
kubectl annotate configmap -n garden gardener-dashboard-configmap meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate configmap -n garden dashboard-assets meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate secret -n garden gardener-dashboard-kubeconfig meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate secret -n garden gardener-dashboard-oidc meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate secret -n garden gardener-dashboard-sessionsecret meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate service -n garden gardener-dashboard-service meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate deployment -n garden gardener-dashboard meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
kubectl annotate ingress -n garden gardener-dashboard-ingress meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-dashboard-runtime --overwrite
```
Now update your 23KE release (change the tag in the 23ke gitrepo source to v1.59.0)

after all components have reconciled resume the gardenlet helmrelease:
```
flux resume helmrelease internal-gardenlet
```
The dashboard helmrelease should have been resumed automatically as the helmrelease has been created under a new name.
