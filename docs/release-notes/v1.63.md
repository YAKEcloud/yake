## 23KE Changes and Upgrade Path
- Before upgrade
	- Due to upstream changes in the gardenlet helm chart, an adujstment to the internal gardenlet installation is required. Resources need to be annotated with a corrected value manually before the update, as follows:
   ```shell
   for type in PodDisruptionBudget ServiceAccount ClusterRole ClusterRoleBinding Role RoleBinding Deployment Service ConfigMap PriorityClass; do
     kubectl -n garden annotate $type -l helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=internal-gardenlet,helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/namespace=flux-system meta.helm.sh/release-name=garden-internal-gardenlet meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=garden --overwrite
   done
   ```
   You might need to rerun this command again later if the `internal-gardenlet` HelmRelease is still not able to reconcile due to an error simliar to
   ```
   Helm install failed: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. ... invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error: ..."
   ```
