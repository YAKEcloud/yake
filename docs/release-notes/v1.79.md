# [gardener/gardener]

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- `[DEVELOPER]` `uncachedObjects` under pkg/client/kubernetes/options.go is now removed from Config struct which is used to set options for new ClientSets. Now the uncached objects can be directly set under `clientOptions.Cache.DisableFor` field. by @ary1992 [#8245]
## 📰 Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` The `DisablingScalingClassesForShoots` feature gate has been promoted to beta. by @rfranzke [#8428]
## ✨ New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` Operators can now use the annotation `gardener.cloud/operation=rotate-observability-credentials` on the `garden` resource to rotate the observability credentials.  by @acumino [#8393]
- `[OPERATOR]` Configuring multiple `reserve-excess-capacity` deployments on `Seed`s is supported now by specifying `.spec.settings.excessCapacityReservation.configs`. by @oliver-goetz [#8356]
- `[USER]` When the Kubernetes control plane version is at least `v1.28`, it is now possible to set the worker pool Kubernetes version to be at most three versions behind the control plane version. Earlier, only a skew of at most two versions was allowed. Find more details [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/kubernetes-v1-28-release/#changes-to-supported-skew-between-control-plane-and-node-versions). by @shafeeqes [#8402]

- `[OPERATOR]` The following image is updated:
