## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEVELOPER]` `uncachedObjects` under pkg/client/kubernetes/options.go is now removed from Config struct which is used to set options for new ClientSets. Now the uncached objects can be directly set under `clientOptions.Cache.DisableFor` field. by @ary1992 [#8245]

Earlier, only a skew of at most two versions was allowed. Find more details [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/kubernetes-v1-28-release/#changes-to-supported-skew-between-control-plane-and-node-versions). by @shafeeqes [#8402]
