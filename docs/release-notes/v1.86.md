# Release Notes v1.86

## YAKE/23KE release notes and upgrade guide

:::danger

This update renames 23ke to YAKE. You need to rename the config secret and GitRepository resource as described.

:::

:::danger

This update definitely needs backups to be configured. If you are running a 23KE instance without backups, enable backups before performing this update.

:::

## Prerequisites
### etcd downgrade

In order to align the versions of `etcd` and `etcd-backup-restore` with gardener/etcd-druid, we perform a downgrade to etcd-3.4.26 and an upgrade to etcd-backup-restore-0.24.7. This is also expected to improve the stability of the backup process. For the upgrade, you need to
- Make sure you have an up-to-date backup of the virtual garden `etcd`s. To perform a full backup you can use the following request:
  ```sh
  kubectl -n garden exec -it etcd-0 curl localhost:8080/snapshot/full
  ```

- Delete the statefulset `etcd` and `etcd-events` in the `garden` namespace
  ```sh
  kubectl delete statefulset -n garden etcd
  kubectl delete statefulset -n garden etcd-events
  ```

During the upgrade helm will create new `persistentVolumes` for the virtual garden's `etcd`s. These volumes are prefixed by `virtual-garden-`.

### Temporarily remove gardener-metrics-exporter

To work around an issue with how YAKE uses gardener-metrics-exporter's chart, delete its deployment

  ```sh
  kubectl delete -n garden deployment gardener-metrics-exporter
  ```


## Upgrade
### Perform the migration from 23ke to YAKE execute the following steps.

- Create copy of Secret `23ke-config` named `yake-config`
  ```sh
  kubectl get secret -n flux-system 23ke-config -o yaml | kubectl-neat | yq '.metadata.name="yake-config"' | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

- Create new GitRepository source named `yake`.
  ```sh
  cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
  kind: GitRepository
  metadata:
    name: yake
    namespace: flux-system
  spec:
    interval: 1m
    ref:
      tag: v1.86.0-0
    timeout: 60s
    url: https://github.com/yakecloud/yake
  EOF
  ```

- Suspend 23ke Kustomization
  ```sh
  flux suspend ks 23ke
  ```

- Relabel Kustomizations created by the main 23ke Kustomization
  ```sh
  kubectl label ks -n flux-system -l kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=23ke kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=yake --overwrite
  ```

- Recreate the main Kustomization with name `yake`
  ```sh
  kubectl get ks -n flux-system 23ke -o yaml | kubectl-neat | yq '.metadata.name="yake" | .spec.sourceRef.name="yake"' | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

- Resume the `yake` Kustomization
  ```sh
  flux resume ks yake
  ```

### Cleanup obsolete resources

Once you confirmed everything's working correctly you can remove obsolete resources.

:::warning
If your base kustomization is itself reconciled by flux, make sure to remove it via git rather than manually.
Otherwise, it will be restored in an active state and may break your setup!
:::

- Delete the old 23ke Kustomization
  ```sh
  kubectl delete ks -n flux-system 23ke
  ```

- Delete the old GitRepository resource
  ```sh
  kubectl delete gitrepo -n flux-system 23ke
  ```

- Delete Secret `23ke-config`
  ```sh
  kubectl delete secret -n flux-system 23ke-config
  ```

- (Optional) Delete the old `persistentVolumeClaims` and their `persistentVolumes` belonging to the already deleted statefulsets of `etcd` and `etcd-events`.
  ```sh
  kubectl get pvc -n garden | grep '^etcd'
  kubectl get pv | grep garden/etcd
  ```

<summary><b>Update shoot-rsyslog-relp to <code>0.3.0</code></b></summary>

# [gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-rsyslog-relp]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` The `security.gardener.cloud/pod-security-enforce` annotation in the ControllerRegistration is set to `baseline`. With this, the pods running in the extension namespace should comply with `baseline` pod-security standard. by @AleksandarSavchev [#17]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` The `shoot-rsyslog-relp` configuration now allows users to specify which tls library should be used by `librerlp` when tls communication is enabled via the `tls.tlsLib` optional field. The possible options are `gnutls` and `openssl`. When the field is omitted, `librelp` uses its default tls library which in most cases is `gnutls`. More information can be found here: https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imrelp.html#tls-tlslib by @plkokanov [#27]
- `[USER]` `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension now supports [Shoot Force Deletion](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_operations.md#force-deletion).  by @acumino [#24]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Metrics for the rsyslog service running on the shoot nodes are now exposed and collected according to the following:
    - The metrics are available on the `node-exporter`'s `/metrics` endpoint.
    - The names of the new metrics match the `rsyslog_pstat_.+` regex.
    - The metrics are scraped and collected in the shoot's prometheus instance.
    - A dedicated plutono dashboard is added which displays the rsyslog metrics. by @plkokanov [#32]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue where the rsyslog systemd unit could become stuck in a failed state immediately after it is installed on the shoot's nodes, if the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension was enabled on the shoot before that. The `configure-rsyslog.sh` script which is responsible for configuring and restarting the rsyslog systemd unit will now wait for the `syslog.service` symlink to be created before attempting to configure and restart the rsyslog systemd unit. by @plkokanov [#34]
- `[OPERATOR]` The shoot-rsyslog-relp extension is now aligned with Gardener's [component checklist](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.82.0/docs/development/component-checklist.md):
  - RBAC for the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension controller have been drastically reduced to only the required ones.
  - The deployment for the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension controller now contains the proper label for HA - `high-availability-config.resources.gardener.cloud/type: controller`
  - The `shoot-rsyslog-relp` admission pod no longer has a `SecurityContext`. This will be automatically added by the `seccomp-profile` webhook of the `gardener-resource-manager`
  - The `rsyslog-relp-configurator` and `rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` pods now use the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile.
  - The init containers of the `rsyslog-relp-configurator` and `rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` pods no longer run in privileged mode.
  - The `rsyslog-relp-configurator` and `rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` now specify resource requests and limits.
  - `PodSecurityPolicy`s for the `rsyslog-relp-configurator` and `rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` are now deployed in the shoot cluster, if its kubernetes version is `1.24.x`. by @plkokanov [#29]
- `[OPERATOR]` The healthcheck controller is now removed. Starting [v1.65.0](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases/tag/v1.65.0), gardenlet perform health checks for all ManagedResources in the Shoot control plane in the Seed. There is no longer need of the custom healthcheck controller in the shoot-rsyslog-relp extension as it was doing the same job. It was performing health check for the ManagedResource it deploys. by @plkokanov [#28]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `rsyslog-relp-configuration-cleaner` is no longer deployed on Shoot deletion with `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension enabled. The Extension deletion occurs after the Worker deletion. There are no Nodes, hence there is no need to clean up registry configuration. by @plkokanov [#30]

# [gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-dns-service]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` CA and server certificates for the admission component are managed automatically. Passing custom certificates via Helm values is not supported anymore. by @timuthy [#266]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` An issue was fixed that caused shoot clusters with a `shoot-dns-service` extension configuration not to be validated during creation. Potential validation errors only happened later and remained unnoticed, e.g. when update requests from Gardenlet were denied and shoot reconciliation got stuck. by @timuthy [#270]

- `[OPERATOR]` Bump github.com/gardener/gardener from 1.84.0 to 1.84.1. by @dependabot[bot] [#262]
# [gardener/external-dns-management]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` `NS` records are not retrieved anymore for all accessible hosted zones to avoid reading all DNS record sets of all hosted zones periodically independently if they are used. Only hosted zones with active `DNSProviders` are synched, but without caring about consequences of `NS` records for subdomains. If there are many large hosted zones accessible for given credentials and there are only  `DNSProviders` using a few of these zones (either by domain or zone include), the period synchronisation of the zone state for all other hosted zones is avoided. This can result in a significant reduction of requests to the provider backend. As a downside of this change, applying a `DNSEntry` for a forwarded subdomain now results in a DNS record set in the parent hosted zone, if the real hosted zone is unknown to the controller. Formerly, applying such a `DNSEnty` resulted in an error state.
  No action is necessary from the users, this is only a "heads up" for the changed behaviour if `NS` records are used for subdomains. by @MartinWeindel [gardener/external-dns-management#336]

# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` All virtual garden access Secrets have to be labeled with with `resources.gardener.cloud/class=shoot`. Otherwise the virtual-GRM won't consider the Secrets and won't renew them. by @rfranzke [#8883]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `ContainerdRegistryHostsDir` feature gate has been promoted to beta and is now turned on by default. by @ialidzhikov [#8873]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Support for the deprecated `NetworkPolicy` annotations `networking.resources.gardener.cloud/from-policy-allowed-ports` and `networking.resources.gardener.cloud/from-policy-pod-label-selector` has been removed. Use `networking.resources.gardener.cloud/from-<some-alias>-allowed-ports` instead ([documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md#networkpolicy-controller)). by @rfranzke [#8883]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[DEVELOPER]` The local Gardener environments for e2e tests running in Prow are now backed by the [`registry-cache`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-registry-cache/) extensions enabled in the Prow cluster. This should have a positive impact on the network I/O for image pulls and resulting costs. by @oliver-goetz [#8880]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `WorkerlessShoots` has been promoted to GA and is now locked to "enabled by default". by @acumino [#8906]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` It is now possible to configure the resources encrypted in the ETCD for shoot clusters, see [this document](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/etcd_encryption_config.md) for more details. by @shafeeqes [#8842]
- `[USER]` The `shoots/viewerkubeconfig` subresource now also restricts viewer access to resources which are specified in the `spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.encryptionConfig` in the Shoot in addition to `Secrets`. by @shafeeqes [#8966]
- `[USER]` It is now possible to request a kubeconfig with read-only access (all APIs except `core/v1.Secret`) for shoot clusters by using the new `shoots/viewerkubeconfig` subresource. Read all about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_access.md#shootsviewerkubeconfig-subresource). by @rfranzke [#8870]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `vpn-seed-server` component now supports IPv4 seed clusters hosting IPv6 shoot clusters.  by @DockToFuture [#8830]
- `[OPERATOR]` It is now possible to configure the resources encrypted in the ETCD for the virtual garden cluster, see [this document](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/operator.md#etcd-encryption-config) for more details. by @shafeeqes [#8842]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[DEPENDENCY]` extension library: An issue causing the Worker restore operation to fail for hibernated Shoots is now fixed. by @ialidzhikov [#8943]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug causing the Shoot to use the wrong istio load balancer if the `ExposureClass` name and the exposureclass handler name are not the same is now fixed.  by @shafeeqes [#8926]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed a bug where a Shoot with an expired machine image or Kubernetes version could be created.
  For machine images: only allow updating to a higher expired machine image version for an existing worker pool
  For Kubernetes versions: do not allow creation of a worker pool with an expired K8s version, but still allow updating an existing worker pool to a higher expired version. by @danielfoehrKn [#8854]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent`'s `OperatingSystemConfig` controller now respects the reconciliation timeout and aborts the reconciliation if it takes too long. by @rfranzke [#8907]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent` now creates temporary directories and files under `/var/lib/gardener-node-agent/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. This fixes issues during `OperatingSystemConfig` reconciliation which occur when `/var` and `/tmp` are backed by different file systems or devices. by @rfranzke [#8894]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-node-agent` now skips disablement and stop attempts of deleted units in case their unit files have already been cleaned up by third parties. by @rfranzke [#8898]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` Change OCI Image Registry from GCR (`eu.gcr.io/gardener-project`) to Artifact-Registry (`europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases`) by @ccwienk [#1645]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Enhanced Client-Side Validation:
  Previously, if there was a validation error, the `submit` buttons on Dialogs and the Create Cluster page would be greyed out. Now, these buttons remain active even if there is a validation error.
  Clicking on the `submit` button in the presence of a validation error will not execute the submit logic. Instead, it will trigger the validation process to ensure that all validation error messages are clearly visible at the respective input fields.
  In addition, we've made it easier to view all error messages. They are now collected and displayed in an alert, similar to how server-side error messages are shown. This enhancement ensures that users are fully aware of any errors that prevent to proceed with the action. by @grolu [#1633]
- `[USER]` An improvement in performance and memory usage on the shoot list has been achieved when a large number of clusters are present. In the past, under heavy load, there were repeated instances where the dashboard became unresponsive due to very high memory consumption. This has been achieved by implementing the following two changes:
  * Throttling of shoot events in the frontend.
    Now, only the `uid` of the modified object is sent to the client, coupled with periodic synchronization of associated shoots.
  * Removal of the key property in the `g-shoot-list-row` component
  * Improved performance of sorting and filtering implementation
  * Faster response times for list shoot request (experimental: must be enabled by an operator)
  * Reduced network traffic for invisible browser tabs  by @holgerkoser [#1637]
- `[OPERATOR]` Added a configuration parameter `Values.global.dashboard.maxRequestBodySize` that specifies the maximum size of the request body. It's value defaults to `100kb`. by @holgerkoser [#1656]
- `[OPERATOR]` Experimental Features:
  * Enhanced Watch Cache Control for List Shoots Requests.
    We've introduced a new feature to fine-tune caching behavior for list shoots requests. A new configuration option, `Values.global.dashboard.experimentalUseWatchCacheForListShoots`, has been added to the `gardener-dashboard` Helm chart. This allows for more precise control over caching with four settings: `never`, `no`, `yes`, and `always`. By default, this is set to `never`. As an experimental feature, we welcome feedback and suggest caution in production environments.
  * Fine-tune the throttle delay per cluster.
    This option, found under `Values.global.dashboard.frontendConfig.experimental.throttleDelayPerCluster`, allows administrators to set the base number of milliseconds delay per cluster. This delay dynamically adjusts the synchronization throttle based on the number of active clusters, optimizing performance and resource utilization in environments with a varying number of clusters. by @holgerkoser [#1637]
