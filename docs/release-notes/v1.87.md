# [gardener/dashboard]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` Removed support for deprecated annotations. These annotations have been deprecated long time ago:

  - `shoot.garden.sapcloud.io/ignore`: If you still have a cluster using this annotation, you can migrate it manually to `shoot.gardener.cloud/ignore` if you need to by @grolu [#1669]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Streamlined Kubernetes cluster upgrades for enhanced user experience. We've removed non-eligible versions from the upgrade selection, replacing them with a hint to indicate the existence of more versions. Additionally, only supported versions are now highlighted on the version chip. To aid in version management, chips for deprecated versions will now display in a warning color, alerting users to the need for an upgrade by @grolu [#1683]
- `[USER]` Hidden GitHub comments will no longer be displayed on the Cluster Details page. by @holgerkoser [#1675]
- `[USER]` Added support to request a time-limited kubeconfig on the cluster details page. The lifetime can be configured on the settings page. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by the gardener dashboard operator. by @grolu [#1666]
- `[OPERATOR]` The feature to request a time-limited kubeconfig is disabled by default. You can enabled it via `.Values.global.dashboard.frontendConfig.shootAdminKubeconfig.enabled`. The maximum expiration seconds can be controlled via `.Values.global.dashboard.frontendConfig.shootAdminKubeconfig.maxExpirationSeconds`. by @grolu [#1666]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[USER]` The broken link to the permission configuration documentation for Azure secrets was fixed. by @MrBatschner [#1667]

- `[USER]` Resolved an issue from Dashboard version `1.70` that prevented the display of descriptions in the 'Update Cluster Version' dropdown selection by @grolu [#1672]
- `[USER]` Improved Navigation in project list filter: Disabled spell check to enhance arrow key navigation reliability. This update addresses an issue where spell check functionality occasionally interfered with keyboard navigation by @grolu [#1696]
- `[USER]` Resolved a styling issue that affected the hover functionality in the Safari browser by @grolu [#1696]
## üèÉ Others

- `[USER]` Introduced tonal variations to our chips and alert designs, previously defined with outline styles by @grolu [#1681]
## üìñ Documentation

- `[OPERATOR]` `node-agent` checks health of `containerd` and `kubelet` now. This replaces the previous bash implementation of these health checks. by @majst01 [#8786]
- `[OPERATOR]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.29. To allow creation/update of 1.29 clusters you will have to update the version of your provider extension(s) to a version that supports 1.29 as well. Please consult the respective releases and notes in the provider extension's repository. by @acumino [#8976]
- `[OPERATOR]` The components managed by gardener now use PDBs with `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy: AlwaysAllow` for clusters with kubernetes version >= 1.26. (For v1.26 clusters (shoots and virtual-garden cluster), the featuregate `PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy ` needs to be turned on in the kube-apiserver. From v1.27 this is enabled by default.) by @shafeeqes [#8969]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Add local setup for dual-stack seeds. by @axel7born [#8983]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Gardener can now support clusters with Kubernetes version 1.29. Extension developers have to prepare individual extensions as well to work with 1.29. by @acumino [#8976]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` False positive `PrometheusCantScrape` alerts for the etcd-druid job in the shoot control plane are no longer firing, even if the `--enable-backup-compaction` feature of `etcd-druid` is not turned on. by @istvanballok [#8988]
- `[OPERATOR]` Allow the `dependency-watchdog-prober` to patch `deployments` and `deployments/scale` resources. by @aaronfern [#9036]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Local single-zone gardener development setups should now work as expected again even if the istio ingress pods are not scheduled on the control plane node. by @ScheererJ [#8998]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Local gardener-operator and multi-zone gardener development setups now use `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` for inbound communication to mitigate cross-node network problems. by @ScheererJ [#8972]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` The following dependency has been updated:
  - `k8s.io/helm@v2.17.0+incompatible` -> `helm.sh/helm/v3@v3.10.3` by @acumino [#8877]
- `[OPERATOR]` Spreading istio pods across hosts is now enforced if there are enough hosts in a particular zone. by @ScheererJ [#8970]
- `[OPERATOR]` The following images are updated:
  - `europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases/3rd/kubesphere/fluent-operator`: v2.3.0 -> v2.7.0
  - `europe-docker.pkg.dev/gardener-project/releases/3rd/kubesphere/fluent-bit`: v2.1.4 -> v2.2.0 by @nickytd [#9031]
- `[OPERATOR]` The reliability of `kube-state-metrics` in the `garden` namespace of the `Seed` cluster has been improved to minimize periods of unavailability for Prometheus metric collection by @petersutter [#8931]
- `[OPERATOR]` The following image is updated:
  - `quay.io/prometheus/prometheus`: `v2.47.0` -> `v2.48.1` by @istvanballok [#8994]
- `[OPERATOR]` kube-proxy is now running in non-privileged mode for K8s >= 1.29 Shoots. The work that needs privileged mode is extracted to an init container. See https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2024/01/05/kube-proxy-non-privileged/. by @shafeeqes [#9000]
- `[OPERATOR]` Plutono is updated to v7.5.28.
  Vali and Valitail are updated to v2.2.13. by @nickytd [#9010]
- `[OPERATOR]` `nginx-ingress-controller` image is updated to `v1.9.5`. by @shafeeqes [#8997]
- `[OPERATOR]` Istio ingress gateway dashboard now always shows a graph for all istio namespaces even if no traffic was received in some of them. by @ScheererJ [#9032]
- `[OPERATOR]` kube-proxy's sidecar container no longer installs its tools at runtime, but comes with its toolset pre-installed. by @ScheererJ [#9006]
- `[DEVELOPER]` On startup, `gardenlet` now removes the `resources.gardener.cloud/gardener-resource-manager` finalizer from `Secret`s related to `ManagedResource`s. by @Kostov6 [#8912]
# [gardener/etcd-druid]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` `EtcdWrapper` has progressed from the alpha stage to the beta stage, which now allows for its default usage in etcd-druid. If you prefer to continue using the etcd-custom-image, you can disable the EtcdWrapper by adjusting the feature flag. by @ishan16696 [gardener/etcd-druid#744]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Add support for overriding storage API endpoint for provider GCS, by adding new field `storageAPIEndpoint` in the GCP/GCS backup secret, with the value in the format `http[s]://host[:port]/storage/v1/`. ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: GCS storage API endpoint will not be overridden for `EtcdCopyBackupsTask`s, since backup buckets may reside in different regions. by @shreyas-s-rao [gardener/etcd-druid#737]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Adds documentation for local setup of Etcd Druid by @anveshreddy18 [gardener/etcd-druid#721]
- `[OPERATOR]` Documentation for the controllers of etcd-druid by @renormalize [gardener/etcd-druid#722]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Upgrade to go 1.21.4 by @seshachalam-yv [gardener/etcd-druid#727]
# [gardener/vpn2]

## üèÉ Others

- `[USER]` Security improvements to the `openvpn` configuration. Due to backwards incompatible change between the vpn server and client a short downtime is to be expected during the initial upgrade. by @dimityrmirchev [gardener/vpn2#53]
# [gardener/etcd-wrapper]

## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` The `etcd` process now runs with umask set to `0077`, this way the files it creates have no permissions on `group` and `others` level. by @AleksandarSavchev [gardener/etcd-wrapper#16]

- `[OPERATOR]` Migration code for Plutono and Vali is now removed. Consider manual cleanup for longterm broken Shoots as described in the PR to avoid leaking Loki's PV. by @rickardsjp [#8999]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `pkg/resourcemanager/predicate.ClassFilter.Active` function was replaced by `IsTransferringResponsibility` and `IsWaitForCleanupRequired`.
  - `pkg/resourcemanager/predicate.ClassFilter.IsTransferringResponsibility` should be used to check whether the `.spec.class` field of a `ManagedResource` has changed and let the controller which was previously responsible for the `ManagedResource` perform any additional/cleanup tasks.
  - `pkg/resourcemanager/predicate.ClassFilter.IsWaitForCleanupRequired` should be used by the controller to which the responsibility was transferred to determine whether it should wait for any tasks/cleanup activities made by the previously responsible controller. by @Kostov6 [#8886]
