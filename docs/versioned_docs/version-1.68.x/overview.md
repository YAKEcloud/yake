# Overview

23KE is a GitOps driven [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) distribution. It helps you to deploy your gardener setup fast and reliably. It is also your companion, when it comes to upgrading and maintaining your setup. All 23KE releases are carefully selected and tested sets of upstream gardener components. With 23KE you can run and configure your complete gardener setup through your git config-repository. Based on [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the actual state of the system is always reconciled to the declarative configuration from your gitrepository which results in full control of your Gardener installation.

## Support
