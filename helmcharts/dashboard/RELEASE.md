# [gardener/dashboard]

## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` Added support for kubeconfigs that include a path in the API server URL by @grolu [#2368]
- `[USER]` CredentialsBinding Support  
  - Support viewing, editing, and creating `CredentialsBindings` referencing `Secrets`  
  - New `Secrets` are now automatically created with a `CredentialsBinding`  
  - Existing `SecretBindings` remain updatable; however, creating new `SecretBindings` via the Dashboard is no longer supported  
  - `CredentialsBindings` referencing `WorkloadIdentity` resources are visible (for cluster creation) but cannot be edited or deleted (yet)  
  - The "Secrets" page has been renamed to "Credentials" and now includes an extra "Kind" column to differentiate `Binding` types. The "Secret" column (showing the referenced credential resource name) has been removed  
  - A hint is displayed when a `Secret` is referenced by another `Binding`, and deletion is prevented if a secret is in use.  
  - Refactored the credential selection dropdown, aligned icons with "Credentials" page by @grolu [#2336]
- `[USER]` Kubernetes warning notifications are dismissed after 5 seconds by @petersutter [#2330]
- `[USER]` Implemented virtual scrolling for the cluster list. Rows are now rendered dynamically as you scroll, replacing the previous paging option. This improvement optimizes performance and provides a smoother browsing experience when viewing large data sets by @grolu [#1674]
- `[USER]` When editing an existing secret, the dialog now displays all associated data, providing clear context for review and modification by @grolu [#2195]
- `[USER]` Notifications will remain visible as long as the mouse hovers over them, rather than disappearing after 5 seconds. by @petersutter [#2280]
- `[USER]` Real-time updates for projects are now supported. Changes and deletions to projects are instantly reflected in the frontend through the WebSocket connection. by @holgerkoser [#2222]
