# [dashboard]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[OPERATOR]* The `values.yaml` file of the `gardener-dashboard` helm chart was restructured: ([gardener/dashboard#1383](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1383), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
  * All properties under `.Values.global` have been moved under `.Values.global.dashboard`, except for `.Values.global.virtualGarden`, `.Values.global.terminal` and `.Values.global.unreachableSeeds`.
  * `.Values.global.virtualGarden.userName` has been renamed to `.Values.global.virtualGarden.dashboardUserName`.
  * `.Values.global.virtualGarden.terminalBootstrapperUserName` has been introduced.
  * A new configuration section `.Values.global.bootstrapper` has been added. This section has similar properties as `.Values.global.dashboard` and allows you to configure the terminal bootstrapper deployment.
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[USER]* Added optional region field to Amazon Route 53 secret dialog ([gardener/dashboard#1430](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1430), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[USER]* Added credential details to infrastructure card on shoot details page ([gardener/dashboard#1432](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1432), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Added access restrictions to issue template ([gardener/dashboard#1422](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1422), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Published docker images for dashboard and dashboard-terminal-bootstrapper are now multi-arch ready. They support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. ([gardener/dashboard#1438](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1438), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
* *[OPERATOR]* Added support for `onmetal` as infrastructure provider ([gardener/dashboard#1441](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1441), [@afritzler](https://github.com/afritzler))
* *[OPERATOR]* The terminal bootstrapping component was factored out and has it's own `Deployment` called `gardener-dashboard-terminal-bootstrapper`. This is a prerequisite to be able to scale up the `gardener-dashboard`, see also #223. ([gardener/dashboard#1383](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1383), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
* *[OPERATOR]* Support using GitHub webhooks when running multiple backend instances. Previously, only one randomly selected instance would receive the webhook, causing only that instance to update its data accordingly. Now, if any instance receives a webhook, all instances are notified and can synchronize with GitHub, ensuring eventual consistency. This improvement will enhance scalability in the future. ([gardener/dashboard#1400](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1400), [@sven-petersen](https://github.com/sven-petersen))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Added monitoring endpoint for a prometheus scraper ([gardener/dashboard#1411](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1411), [@sven-petersen](https://github.com/sven-petersen))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Added support for `local` infrastructure provider. This allows to use the dashboard with local gardener installations. See also: [Deploying Gardener locally](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/deployment/getting_started_locally.md) ([gardener/dashboard#1434](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1434), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[USER]* Fixed: Sort cluster list by `technical id` did not work ([gardener/dashboard#1412](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1412), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[USER]* Gardener Dashboard now shows all available machine types / volume types for a region independent of the zone selection. As virtual zones are mapped to physical zones for each infrastructure account individually, Gardener Dashboard is unable to determine which zone - type combination will work for the shoot workers ([gardener/dashboard#1414](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1414), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[USER]* Focus Mode: Stale clusters sometimes did not show as greyed out ([gardener/dashboard#1416](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1416), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[USER]* Did not use configured `config.clusterIdentity` when building gardenlogin kubeconfig ([gardener/dashboard#1428](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1428), [@j2L4e](https://github.com/j2L4e))
* *[OPERATOR]* If no (valid) cloud provider is configured that the dashboard supports, this will no longer result in an fatal error 500. Instead this will be rendered as an alert in the dashboard ([gardener/dashboard#1434](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1434), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed: The Dashboard did not recognize `providerTypes: ['*']` as valid `seedSelector` ([gardener/dashboard#1434](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1434), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed: Seeds in other regions than the shoot did not show up if no `seedCandidateDeterminationStrategy` set in dashboard config ([gardener/dashboard#1434](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1434), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Added missing chart value for condition configuration to helm chart ([gardener/dashboard#1446](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1446), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The make build command now also works for new macbooks with ARM processor ([gardener/dashboard#1438](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1438), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Run the helm chart unit tests as part of the pipeline check step. ([gardener/dashboard#1451](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1451), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
## üèÉ Others
* *[USER]* Cluster list: Known conditions now have a defined order in the readiness column. If the list is sorted by the readiness column, the clusters are now grouped by the conditions with error state. Please use the recently introduced `issue since` column to sort the list without grouping ([gardener/dashboard#1412](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1412), [@grolu](https://github.com/grolu))
* *[OPERATOR]* Identity chart: bumped version of dex to `v2.36.0-distroless` ([gardener/dashboard#1443](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1443), [@petersutter](https://github.com/petersutter))
* *[OPERATOR]* Remove limit defaults from helm charts for gardener-dashboard and identity ([gardener/dashboard#1449](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1449), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `sessionAffinity` of the dashboard service can now be configured via the property `.values.global.dashboard.sessionAffinity`. The default is still `"ClientIP"` but will be changed to `"None"` in future dashboard versions. If you want sticky session in the future you should explicitly configure it and not rely on the default anymore. ([gardener/dashboard#1459](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1459), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Updated dashboard dependencies ([gardener/dashboard#1453](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/pull/1453), [@holgerkoser](https://github.com/holgerkoser))
