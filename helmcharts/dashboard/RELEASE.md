# [gardener/dashboard]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` Cost Object: You must migrate existing configurations to the new format. Previously, the configuration used `Values.global.dashboard.frontendConfig.costObject`. It should now be updated to `Values.global.dashboard.frontendConfig.costObjects`, which is a list of objects. Each object in this list must include a `type` property, alongside existing properties such as `title`, `description`, and `regex`. by @petersutter [#2102]
- `[USER]` Removed the ability for users to retrieve their token from the My Account page. by @petersutter [#2131]
