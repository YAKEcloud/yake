## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` DNS configuration is now maintained under `spec.extensions`. When modifying the DNS configuration of an existing shoot, the settings will be migrated to this new location, and the `syncProvidersFromShootSpecDNS` flag will be set to false by @grolu [#1888]
- `[USER]` The basic auth observability URLs and credentials are hidden if the OIDC observability URLs are displayed. Instead, fetch the credentials from the `<shootname>.monitoring` `Secret`. See also https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/9867 by @petersutter [#1899]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The local Vite dev server now starts on HTTPS at `https://localhost:8443` instead of `http://localhost:8080`. Run `yarn setup` to generate a server certificate and add the CA to the macOS keychain. by @holgerkoser [#1894]

- `[USER]` You can now configure custom shoot fields directly from the dashboard using the new editor, eliminating the need to use `kubectl`. by @petersutter [#1926]
- `[USER]` Enhanced DNS configuration logic to configure extension DNS settings in the `spec.extensions` section by @grolu [#1888]
- `[OPERATOR]` In order to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks a random value is now part of the `state` parameter during the OIDC authorization code flow. by @holgerkoser [#1894]
- `[OPERATOR]` Added [host-prefix](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes#host-prefix) to all cookie names. by @holgerkoser [#1894]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

## üèÉ Others

- `[USER]` Readiness Chips improvement: All `Shoot` constraints that are not in the condition `status != "True"` are shown. This includes conditions with statuses `"False"`, `"Unknown"` and `"Progressing"`. Previously, only constraints with an error code were displayed. by @petersutter [#1887]
