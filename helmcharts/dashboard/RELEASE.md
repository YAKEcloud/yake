# [gardener/dashboard]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` Tickets are no longer automatically closed by the dashboard when a shoot is deleted. This should be handled by a different component instead, like a robot. by @petersutter [#1517]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `gardener-dashboard` `Deployment` now runs with high availability config (with label `high-availability-config.resources.gardener.cloud/type=server`). For more information about the HA config see [resource-manager.md#high-availability-config](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md#high-availability-config) by @petersutter [#1504]
- `[OPERATOR]` Terminals: The `connectSrc` directive of the Content Security Policy no longer permits the use of `wss:` by default. You need to set up the allowed hosts that the browser can connect to for the web terminal feature. This can be done using `Values.global.terminal.allowedHostSourceList`. For more details see [webterminals.md#allowlist-for-hosts](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/blob/master/docs/operations/webterminals.md#allowlist-for-hosts) by @petersutter [#1561]
- `[OPERATOR]` Terminals: As gardener took over the responsibility of providing kube-apiserver endpoints with trusted certificates the `terminal-bootstrap` component was dropped. Make sure to clean up the created resources of the terminal bootstrapper. See PR description for more details. by @petersutter [#1561]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Added an input field to configure the maintenance time window duration. The textfield hints now show the UTC begin and end time by @grolu [#1587]

The documentation and a detailed example can be found in the dashboard operation guidelines https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/blob/master/docs/operations/customization.md by @holgerkoser [#1568]
- `[OPERATOR]` Terminal: By default, the access service account within the garden terminal pod is bound to `gardener.cloud:system:administrators`, not `cluster-admin` anymore. by @petersutter [#1541]
