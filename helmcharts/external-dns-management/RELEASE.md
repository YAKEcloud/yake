# [gardener/external-dns-management]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` Deprecated `DNSEntry.spec.reference`. The field will be removed with a future release. by @marc1404 [#558]
- `[USER]` The values of provider secrets are now validated restrictedly. Because of this policy change, minor inconsistencies tolerated formerly can now lead to failing validation and therefore for failing provider states. Especially check for leading and trailing whitespaces, empty values or unknown secret keys. by @MartinWeindel [#535]
