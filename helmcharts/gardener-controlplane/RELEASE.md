## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEPENDENCY]` The `webhookcmd.NewAddToManagerSimpleOptions` function was removed, please use `webhookcmd.NewAddToManagerOptions` instead. by @timuthy [#8725]
- `[DEPENDENCY]` The `extensionswebhook.New` forbids to pass `mutators` and `validators` at the same time. Please use separate webhooks for validating and mutating actions if required. by @timuthy [#8725]
- `[OPERATOR]` All the functionality related to the deprecated field `seed.spec.secretRef` has been removed and subsequently `seed.spec.secretRef` will be dropped from the Seed API in a later release of Gardener. Please check your `Seed`s and remove any usage before upgrading to this Gardener version. by @acumino [#8833]
- `[USER]` With this PR, the plutono UI will be able to fetch newer logs only. The older logs, which are submitted via the tenant operator will not be visible in the UI. To access the older logs, for the standard log retention period , either set the `--org-id` parameter for `valicli` or the `X-Scope-Org` http request header for `curl` or `wget` needs to be supplied to fetch them, using the port-forwarded service to the `vali` target. by @nickytd [#8800]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[DEVELOPER]` The extension webhook registration does now differentiate between mutating and validating actions and creates matching `ValidatingWebhookConfigration` or `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` objects. Earlier, only `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`s were created. by @timuthy [#8725]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `UseGardenerNodeAgent` feature gate is now enabled for the local development scenario. You can read more about `gardener-node-agent` [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/node-agent.md). by @rfranzke [#8847]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` Add full single-stack IPv6 support for gardener provider-local  by @nschad [#8574]
- `[DEPENDENCY]` Webhook registration `webhookcmd.NewAddToManagerOptions` can now be used for admission controllers performing validation and mutation in the Garden cluster. This option automatically creates and maintains required `{Mutating,Validating}WebhookConfiguration` objects as well as comes with an automated management for CA and server certificates. by @timuthy [#8725]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenlet'`s `Shoot` care controller now garbage-collects orphaned `Lease` objects related to no longer existing `Node`s - see [this upstream issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/119660) for more details. by @rfranzke [#8817]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug has been fixed which prevented shoot reconciliations in case the old `system:machine-controller-manager-seed` `ClusterRole` was still referenced in the `RoleBinding` for `machine-controller`-manager`. by @himanshu-kun [#8816]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug causing `EveryNodeReady` condition to be added in workerless shoot status if gardenlet of the given shoot's seed becomes unhealthy is fixed. by @gardener-ci-robot [#8889]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in the `Seed` care controller has been fixed which caused the `Seed` to remain in `NotReady` state when `vali` was disabled in `gardenlet`'s component config (via `.logging.vali.enabled=false`) while logging was enabled (`.logging.enabled=true`). by @rfranzke [#8840]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Federate non-namespaced metrics, e.g. kube_node_spec_taint, kube_node_spec_unschedulable.  by @adenitiu [#8850]

- `[OPERATOR]` showing kubelet version and OS image version in Plutono Node/Worker Pool overview dashboard by @tedteng [#8757]
