# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` Component config change for `gardener-operator`: `extensionVirtualClusterConfig` was renamed to `extension`. by @MartinWeindel [#10277]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[DEVELOPER]` Enable apiserver feature gate `UseNamespacedCloudProfile` in local setup by default. Though, feature gate should not be enabled in production environments yet, until access control is implemented. by @LucaBernstein [#10266]
- `[OPERATOR]` `kube-proxy` now has a readiness probe so that a node will only become ready for workloads after `kube-proxy` was ready at least once. by @ScheererJ [#10407]
- `[OPERATOR]` Host spread for shoots with failure tolerance `node` (`.spec.controlPlane.highAvailability.failureTolerance.type`) is now accomplished via `minDomains`. Earlier, this happened at a best effort basis only. If a seed was having less than 3 nodes at the time the control-plane pods were scheduled, the desired pod distribution was not possible. by @timuthy [#10400]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` Introduced metrics exposing the Garden resource's condition and last operation. by @rickardsjp [#10393]
- `[OPERATOR]` Add `NamespacedCloudProfile` controller to enable usage of `NamespacedCloudProfile` in `Shoot` spec. by @LucaBernstein [#10266]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-operator` is now capable of deploying admission controllers for the virtual-garden via `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension` resources. by @MartinWeindel [#10277]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Extension `provider-local` has a dummy admission controller now. by @MartinWeindel [#10277]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[DEVELOPER]` A bug was fixed that led to `env-test` setup errors when `make test-integration` was executed locally. by @timuthy [#10456]
