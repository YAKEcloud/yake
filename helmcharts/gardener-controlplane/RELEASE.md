## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[OPERATOR]* All the functionality related to the deprecated field `spec.dns.ingressDomain` in the Seed has been removed. Subsequently, `.spec.dns.ingressDomain` will be dropped from the Seed API in a later release of Gardener. Before upgrading to this Gardener version, make sure to switch all seeds to `.spec.ingress` and `.spec.dns.provider`. Please find more details here, https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/deployment/deploy_gardenlet_manually.md#kubernetes-cluster-that-should-be-registered-as-a-seed-cluster ([gardener/gardener#7529](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7529), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* The fields `.spec.dns.provider.domains` and `.spec.dns.provider.zones` in the Seed are deprecated, and all the functionality related to the deprecated fields has been removed. Subsequently these fields will be dropped from the Seed API in a later release of Gardener. Before upgrading to this Gardener version, make sure to switch all seeds not to use these fields. ([gardener/gardener#7529](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7529), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `ForceRestore` feature gate has been removed. ([gardener/gardener#7543](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7543), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
* *[OPERATOR]* The Gardener API server now has the following validation enforced for ManagedSeeds: ([gardener/gardener#7546](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7546), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
  * It is now forbidden to set the Seed `secretRef` when the Shoot static token kubeconfig is disabled. (`ManagedSeed` admission plugin)

## ‚ú® New Features
* *[OPERATOR]* A new feature for toplogy-aware routing is introduced. The feature enables topology-aware traffic routing in the seed clusters using the Kubernetes feature `TopologyAwareHints`. For more details, see the [Topology-aware Traffic Routing documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.66.0/docs/usage/topology_aware_routing.md). ([gardener/gardener#7191](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7191), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* A new feature gate (alpha) `FullNetworkPoliciesInRuntimeCluster` was introduced. If enabled, it adds `NetworkPolicy`s to namespaces running extensions. Only enable this when all extensions registered in your system support it. ([gardener/gardener#7589](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7589), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* Updates to the `AuditPolicy` referenced by `Shoot`s are now also validated against the Kubernetes versions of those shoot clusters. This fixes an issue where it was possible to specify an unsupported `audit.k8s.io` version when updating the `ConfigMap` which contains the `AuditPolicy`. ([gardener/gardener#7563](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7563), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
* *[OPERATOR]* A bug has been fixed which prevented `blackbox-exporter` to scrape the `kube-apiserver`s of shoot clusters via the `istio-ingressgateway`. As a result, its "external probe" was always failing. ([gardener/gardener#7603](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7603), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixes control-plane migration of hibernated shoot being stuck if shoot was hibernated for 24h ([gardener/gardener#7608](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7608), [@Kumm-Kai](https://github.com/Kumm-Kai))
## üìñ Documentation
* *[USER]* Add additional information about custom server config to custom-dns-config docs. ([gardener/gardener#7559](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7559), [@axel7born](https://github.com/axel7born))
* *[USER]* Adding documentation on the webhook remediator and how users can to fix it ([gardener/gardener#7535](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7535), [@etiennnr](https://github.com/etiennnr))

([gardener/gardener#7587](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7587), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `BackupEntry` and `Shoot` "Migration" reconcilers were removed, as part of the removal of the control plane migration "bad case" scenario. ([gardener/gardener#7543](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7543), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
