# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` The `url` annotation in `<shoot-name>.monitoring` secrets in the project namespace is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use the `plutono-url` annotation instead. by @oliver-goetz [#10735]
- `[OPERATOR]` There is an incompatible change in the `Garden` (`gardens.operator.gardener.cloud`) custom resource, which required manual action:  
  - Fields `.spec.virtualCluster.dns.domains` and `.spec.runtimeCluster.ingress.domains` were changed from type string to object with a field `name` and an optional field `provider`,  e.g., in `JSON` format, replace `"domains": ["domain1.example.com", "domain2.example.com"]` with `"domains": [{"name": "domain1.example.com"}, {"name": "domain2.example.com"}]`.  
  - `.spec.runtimeCluster.ingress.domains` is required now  
  - `.spec.virtualCluster.dns.domains` is required now by @MartinWeindel [#10645]
- `[OPERATOR]` The optional deployment of cert-management component has been removed. As it was only introduced recently and probably not used, this change should have no impact typically. by @MartinWeindel [#10802]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[USER]` Allow changing `shoot.spec.cloudProfile` between `CloudProfile` and its descendant `NamespacedCloudProfile`s. by @LucaBernstein [#10811]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Allow for custom machine images in `NamespacedCloudProfile`s and add the `spec.providerConfig` field. by @LucaBernstein [#10629]
- `[USER]` The URLs of Shoot `plutono`, `prometheus` and `alertmanager` are now stored as annotations in `<shoot-name>.monitoring` secret in the project namespace. by @oliver-goetz [#10735]
- `[OPERATOR]` Enhance the `gardener-operator` to deploy `DNSRecords` and `BackupBucket` for the virtual garden resource.  
  `DNSRecords` are only deployed if at least one provider is specified at `.spec.dns.providers` in the `Garden` resource.  
  A `BackupBucket` is created if the `.spec.virtualCluster.etcd.backup` section is specified. An existing backup bucket on the infrastructure becomes automatically managed this way. by @MartinWeindel [#10645]
- `[DEVELOPER]` gardener-apiserver: The `ExtensionLabels` admission plugin now also sets labels to `WorkloadIdentity`s. by @dimityrmirchev [#10786]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[DEVELOPER]` `gardener-node-agent` applies inline files before applying containerd registries now. by @oliver-goetz [#10831]

- `[OPERATOR]` The deployment of `BackupBucket` resource in the runtime cluster is skipped if no suitable operator extension is deployed. by @MartinWeindel [#10837]
