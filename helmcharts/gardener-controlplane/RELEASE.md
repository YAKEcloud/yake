## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` The `Seed` API field `spec.backup.secretRef` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Gardener in favor of `spec.backup.credentialsRef`, please adapt your seed manifests to use the new `credentialsRef` field.  by @vpnachev [#11583]
- `[OPERATOR]` Gardener no longer sets the flags `--audit-log-(path|maxsize|maxbackups)` on shoot `kube-apiserver`s, `gardener-apiserver` or Garden's `virtual-garden-kube-apiserver`. If you rely on the audit logs being available in the file `/tmp/audit/audit.log` in the container's file system, please follow [controlplane-webhooks](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/extensions/controlplane-webhooks.md#kube-apiserver) and set the required flags via mutating webhook.  by @vpnachev [#11935]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `ManagedSeed` API field `spec.gardenlet.config.seedConfig.spec.backup.secretRef` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Gardener in favor of `spec.gardenlet.config.seedConfig.spec.backup.credentialsRef`, please adapt your managedseed manifests to use the new `credentialsRef` field.  by @vpnachev [#11583]
- `[OPERATOR]` The legacy `support.gardener.cloud/eu-access*` labels and annotations on `CloudProfile`s and `Seed`s are no longer synced automatically. You have to use the new API established in Gardener v1.107 (released in 11/2024). Read more about it [here](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot/access_restrictions/). Please make sure to manually remove these labels and annotations from your `CloudProfile`s and `Seed`s! by @rfranzke [#11913]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `Gardenlet` API field `spec.config.seedConfig.spec.backup.secretRef` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Gardener in favor of `spec.config.seedConfig.spec.backup.credentialsRef`, please adapt your gardenlet manifests to use the new `credentialsRef` field.  by @vpnachev [#11583]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `GardenletConfiguration` configuration file field `seedConfig.spec.backup.secretRef` has been deprecated and will be removed in future version of Gardener in favor of `seedConfig.spec.backup.credentialsRef`, please adapt your `GardenletConfiguration` configuration files to use the new `credentialsRef` field.  by @vpnachev [#11583]
- `[USER]` The legacy `support.gardener.cloud/eu-access*` labels and annotations on `Shoot`s are no longer synced automatically. You have to use the new API established in Gardener v1.107 (released in 11/2024). Read more about it [here](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot/access_restrictions/#shoot).
