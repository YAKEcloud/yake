## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* An issue causing deletion of a legacy (wrongly configured) Shoot cluster to be denied because of network ranges overlapping with the default VPN network is now fixed. ([gardener/gardener#8138](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8138), [@oliver-goetz](https://github.com/oliver-goetz))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `terraformer` library will now skip deletion of the Terraformer pod when the request context has been canceled. This change aims to prevent inconsistencies in Terraform state by attempting to allow uninterrupted execution of healthy Terraformer pods. ([gardener/gardener#8107](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8107), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
* *[OPERATOR]* A bug has been fixed in the `garden/fluent-bit` that caused a failure in creating `networkpolicies` for scraping metrics. ([gardener/gardener#8074](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8074), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
## üèÉ Others
* *[OPERATOR]* Plutono is now updated to v7.5.22 ([gardener/gardener#8101](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8101), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed flaky operator behaviour with regards to istio deployment caused by concurrent update of garden object ([gardener/gardener#8104](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8104), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `Deploying Shoot namespace in Seed` step was slightly improved.

([gardener/gardener#8119](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8119), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
* *[OPERATOR]* The reconciliation time limit for the controller resource reconciliation, e.g. for `ManagedResource`, has been increased from `1m` to `3m`. ([gardener/gardener#8091](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8091), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
