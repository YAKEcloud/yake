# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` A bug has been fixed which was allowing users to set `Shoot` oidc configurations for the `kube-apiserver` without setting the `clientID` and `issuerURL` fields in `spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig`, which would lead to the `kube-apiserver` stuck in a `Error` state. gardener-apiserver now requires both `clientID` and `issuerURL` fields to be set when the `spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig` field is specified. by @AleksandarSavchev [#10461]
- `[OPERATOR]` `credentialsBinding.credentialsRef` is now an immutable field. by @dimityrmirchev [#10365]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[USER]` Users are allowed to change `shoot.spec.credentialsBindingName` and reference another `CredentialsBinding` only if they have the permissions to read both the old and newly referenced credential. by @dimityrmirchev [#10365]
- `[USER]` Users can migrate from `shoot.spec.secretBindingName` to `shoot.spec.credentialsBindingName` only if the referenced credential remains the same and is not changed during the process. by @dimityrmirchev [#10365]
- `[OPERATOR]` Allow project users to read `NamespacedCloudProfile`s and for project admins to make adjustments to machine types and volume types. by @LucaBernstein [#10485]
- `[OPERATOR]` Alerts based on the `proposals_failed_total` metric of the etcd cluster are not raised anymore. by @renormalize [#10524]
- `[DEVELOPER]` A new predicate `extensions/pkg/predicate.GardenSecurityProviderType` can be used to select resources from the `security.gardener.cloud` group that are related to the passed provider type. by @dimityrmirchev [#10499]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` The `gardener-operator` metrics are now automatically scraped by the `garden` Prometheus. by @maboehm [#10464]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduce custom RBAC verbs to allow for modification of `.spec.{kubernetes,machineImages}` in `NamespacedCloudProfile`s. by @LucaBernstein [#10485]
- `[OPERATOR]` The feature gate `NewVPN` is introduced for the `gardenlet` component. If enabled, the new VPN implementation (Golang rewrite) is used for all `Shoot`s of the respective `Seed`. In this case, the old implementation can be disabled for a single `Shoot` by annotating the shoot resource with `alpha.control-plane.shoot.gardener.cloud/disable-new-vpn=true`. For `Seed`s with disabled feature gate, the new implementation can be enabled for a single shoot by annotating it with `alpha.control-plane.shoot.gardener.cloud/disable-new-vpn=false`. by @MartinWeindel [#9774]

- `[DEVELOPER]` An issue was fixed that rejected the creation of workerless shoots in the local setup. by @timuthy [#10498]
