## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* A bug causing `gardenlet` to panic when `admission-controller` is upgraded to `v1.71` but gardenlet is still on `v1.70`. ([gardener/gardener#7989](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7989), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* Several low timeouts (30s) that were introduced in v1.71.0 for several steps are now reverted as in some cases the Network/ControlPlane reconciliation cannot succeed for 30s.
