# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEVELOPER]` Moved `extensions/pkg/predicate` to `pkg/controllerutils/predicate`. Please adjust imports accordingly. by @Wieneo [#12026]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `MutatorWithShootClient` has been removed from Gardener. If your mutator requires a shoot client, it should implement the new [`WantsShootClient`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/70168f44c8b12541ea31cb688a7a7e18757e847f/extensions/pkg/webhook/handler.go#L278) interface instead. The corresponding client can be found in the passed context via the [`ShootClientContextKey`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/70168f44c8b12541ea31cb688a7a7e18757e847f/extensions/pkg/webhook/handler.go#L268). by @timuthy [#12289]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Moved `extensions/pkg/util/cloudprofile` to `pkg/utils/gardener/cloudprofile`. Please adjust imports accordingly. by @Wieneo [#12026]
- `[USER]` The `.spec.kubernetes.clusterAutoscaler.maxEmptyBulkDelete` field in the Shoot API is deprecated in favor of `.spec.kubernetes.clusterAutoscaler.maxScaleDownParallelism` and will be removed once gardener stops supporting kubernetes `v1.32`. Please adapt your Shoot manifests accordingly. by @takoverflow [#12115]
- `[OPERATOR]` gardenlet no longer deploys ControlPlane resources with `.spec.purpose=exposure` for Shoots using `unmanaged` DNS provider. gardenlet will now cleanup any ControlPlane exposure resource as part of the reconciliation and deletion flows for such Shoots. by @theoddora [#12162]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` The `Seed` backup secret is no longer copied from the `Shoot` infrastructure credentials in case an operator does not provide an existent backup secret and [`DoNotCopyBackupCredentials` feature gate](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.121.0/docs/deployment/feature_gates.md) is enabled for `gardenlet`. If you configure `seed.spec.backup.credentialsRef` or `seed.spec.backup.secretRef`, make sure that the referred credential already exists. For production setups, it is advised that operators configure a separate set of credentials for `Seed` backup and `Shoot` infrastructure. by @dimityrmirchev [#12168]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `CredentialsRotationWithoutWorkersRollout` feature gate has been promoted to beta and is now enabled by default. by @rfranzke [#12236]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` Extension mutators or validators can now retrieve a corresponding `Cluster` object from the passed `context.Context`. The [`WantsClusterObject`(https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/70168f44c8b12541ea31cb688a7a7e18757e847f/extensions/pkg/webhook/handler.go#L285) interface must be implemented for this functionality. by @timuthy [#12289]
- `[USER]` Concurrent drain and deletion of nodes that require drain can now be configured for `cluster-autoscaler` via the field `.spec.kubernetes.clusterAutoscaler.maxDrainParallelism` in the Shoot API. by @takoverflow [#12115]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenlet` now doesn't scale up deployments during `Shoot` reconciliation if they have `dependency-watchdog.gardener.cloud/meltdown-protection-active` annotation on them. by @ashwani2k [#12314]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[USER]` A bug causing the `kube-apiserver` to crash when anonymous authentication is configured via `StructuredAuthentication` was fixed. by @dimityrmirchev [#12198]
- `[OPERATOR]` An issue causing the Shoot credentials rotation status not to correctly get updated, after all the manual in-place pending workers are updated, is now fixed. by @shafeeqes [#12306]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Enhance DualStack migration docs with knowledge about manual reconciliation. by @adenitiu [#12246]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenadm` is now published as a container image in release and snapshot builds. by @timebertt [#12294]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduce the `perses-operator` to `Garden` and `Seed` clusters. by @rickardsjp [#12084]
- `[OPERATOR]` Clarified and enforced policy in the Kubernetes version support process to retain only the latest 5 minor versions, improving security by dropping older, unpatched versions more consistently. by @vlerenc [#12201]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Added the helper function `CurrentLifecycleClassification(version)` to evaluate the current classification of a given `ExpirableVersion`. by @LucaBernstein [#12298]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Introduced new version classifications `unavailable` and `expired`. They are not meant to be set manually but should act as computed classification states. by @LucaBernstein [#12298]
