## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` A new extension lifecycle strategy `reconcile: AfterWorker` is now available for Extensions to use in their `ControllerRegistration`. by @maboehm [#9472]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[DEVELOPER]` provider-local: An issue causing the backup directory not to be deleted after successful control plane migration is now fixed. by @Kostov6 [#9182]
- `[DEVELOPER]` An issue was fixed that caused `make verify` to fail because of `logcheck` build issues. by @timuthy [#9458]
- `[OPERATOR]` Restarting systemd units by annotating the node now works without specifying the `.service` suffix in unit names. by @oliver-goetz [#9459]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Images for local development should now be properly rebuilt, if changes are made only to files in the `main` packages under `./cmd/...` directories.  by @plkokanov [#9496]
- `[OPERATOR]` During the `restore` phase of control plane migration of HA shoots, the shoot's `kube-apiserver` is deployed immediately after one replica is ready for each of the events and main `etcd`s. The event and main `etcd`s are scaled up to 3 replicas (the current default for HA shoots) after the `kube-apiserver` is deployed and ready. This should greatly reduce the downtime during control plane migration of HA shoots. by @plkokanov [#9462]
- `[OPERATOR]` A service is added for the shoot cluster's kube-system/node-problem-detector daemonset by @istvanballok [#9483]
- `[OPERATOR]` Secret `vpn-seed-server-dh` will no longer be created as [gardener/vpn2](https://github.com/gardener/vpn2) release `v0.23.0` removed the need for supplying the vpn server with `Diffie‚ÄìHellman` parameters. by @ary1992 [#9386]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `Data Transfer` graph from the `Istio Mesh Dashboard` in the seed `plutono` now uses `rate` when displaying the `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total` and `istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total` metrics. by @plkokanov [#9495]
- `[OPERATOR]` Correct NodeNotHealthy filtering query to use `v1beta1constants.TaintNodeCriticalComponentsNotReady` by @adenitiu [#9470]
- `[DEVELOPER]` New `consistOf` and `contain` Gomega matchers for `ManagedResource`s were added. Tests can concisely check for expected objects a `ManagedResource` is responsible for. by @timuthy [#9421]
## üìñ Documentation

- `[DEVELOPER]` Add `yq` as a local setup prerequisite. by @marc1404 [#9510]
