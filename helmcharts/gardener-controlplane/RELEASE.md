## 🏃 Others
* *[OPERATOR]* The worker count for the [NetworkPolicy controller](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md#networkpolicy-controller) in GRM was increased to `20`. This is necessary to create and update `NetworkPolicies` in time, esp. on larger seed clusters.
