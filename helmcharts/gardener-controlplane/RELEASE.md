## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` The `gardener-resource-manager` does not mark `Deployment`s as progressing when there are still completed `Pod`s in the system. by @timuthy [#10727]
## 🏃 Others

- `[OPERATOR]` IPv6 support for `node-local-dns`. by @DockToFuture [#10707]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue that would cause the entry for the `machine-state` in the `ShootState` to be overwritten with nil data during control plane migration, if the `migrate` phase errored and was retried after the `MachineDeployment`, `MachineSet` and `Machine` objects were deleted, which would result in the Shoot's nodes to be recreated during Control Plane Migration. by @plkokanov [#10695]
