## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `[USER]` The two additional labels `worker.gardener.cloud/image-name` and `worker.gardener.cloud/image-version` that were previously introduced and attached to worker nodes are removed again to fix a regression that causes the `kubelet` to restart on nodes that are due to be upgraded to a new OS but not rolled yet which causes their `Pod`s to become temporarily unready. by @gardener-ci-robot [#8551]
