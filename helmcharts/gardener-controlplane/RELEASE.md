# [gardener]
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* Gardener sets [`minDomains`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/#spread-constraint-definition) for shoot system components to the number of zones configured in the system component worker pool(s). ([gardener/gardener#7826](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7826), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
  * ⚠️ It is strongly recommended to place at least one worker node per availability zone for system component workers in order to ensure hitch-free rolling updates and scheduling of pods. You may need to adjust the `maximum: <number-of-zones>` values of your system component worker pool(s).
  * This configuration only takes effect for clusters which enabled feature gate `MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread` (enabled by default as of Kubernetes `v1.27`).
* *[USER]* The `spec.secretBindingName`, `.spec.networking`, `.spec.networking.type`, `spec.maintenance.autoUpdate.machineImageVersion` fields in the Shoot API are now made optional to prepare for the introduction of workerless Shoots feature. Please see https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/7635 for more details. ([gardener/gardener#7828](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7828), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* The promoted or deprecated feature gates `ManagedIstio` and `ReversedVPN` have been removed. Remove these feature gates before updating to this version of Gardener. ([gardener/gardener#7830](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7830), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The `gardener.cloud/timestamp` annotation is now formatted as `time.RFC3339Nano`. ([gardener/gardener#7796](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7796), [@dimityrmirchev](https://github.com/dimityrmirchev))
## ✨ New Features
* *[USER]* It is now possible to specify custom linux kernel settings per worker pool for `Shoot`s via `.spec.provider.workers[].sysctls`, which may override Gardener default values. ([gardener/gardener#7825](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7825), [@ScheererJ](https://github.com/ScheererJ))
* *[USER]* `Secret`s/`ConfigMap`s referenced in `.spec.resources` of `Shoot`s are now protected with a finalizer to ensure they do not disappear from the system as long as they are still referenced somewhere. ([gardener/gardener#7850](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7850), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[OPERATOR]* `gardener-operator` now deploys `Istio` components into the garden runtime cluster. ([gardener/gardener#7817](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7817), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[OPERATOR]* The [`highavailabilityconfig` webhook](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md#high-availability-config) configures topology spread constraints with `minDomains=<number-of- zones>`. This configuration only takes effect for clusters which enabled feature gate `MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread` (default as of Kubernetes `v1.27`). Please note, this configuration will require at least one worker node per registered availability zone so that Kubernetes can spread the respective seed, shoot and control-plane pods across zones. ([gardener/gardener#7826](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7826), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[OPERATOR]* Gardener now supports seed clusters with Kubernetes versions up to `v1.26`. ([gardener/gardener#7831](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7831), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[OPERATOR]* Annotations in `seed.spec.settings.loadBalancerServices.annotations` are now applied to the Nginx-Ingress load balancer service in the seed cluster. ([gardener/gardener#7835](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7835), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `gardener-operator` does now also manage `kube-state-metrics`. ([gardener/gardener#7836](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7836), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The local deployment of Gardener is extended so that it is now possible to create a second single zone HA `Seed`. This `Seed` can be used to test the control plane migration scenario for HA `Shoot`s. Additionally, make targets were added to trigger the control plane migration integration test with HA `Shoot`s: `test-e2e-local-migration-ha-single-zone` to test the migration locally, and `ci-e2e-kind-migration-ha-single-zone` mainly intended to be used in Gardener prow jobs. ([gardener/gardener#7742](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7742), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* Prevent nil pointer exceptions on shoot deletion in `gardenlet` when seed namespace is gone. ([gardener/gardener#7827](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7827), [@oliver-goetz](https://github.com/oliver-goetz))
* *[OPERATOR]* gardener-apiserver: The kubelet version constraint validation is now fixed to also cover the Shoot K8s version update. Previously it was possible to update the Shoot K8s version to a new minor version when the Shoot has a worker pool with machine image version which kubeletVersionConstraint does not match the new K8s version. ([gardener/gardener#7853](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7853), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
## 📖 Documentation
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The flags which went out-of-support in MCM v0.49.0 have been cleaned up from MCM deployment yaml. ([gardener/gardener#7829](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7829), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
## 🏃 Others
* *[OPERATOR]* Suppress the event-logger `nest` filter's warnings in the fluent-bit. ([gardener/gardener#7832](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7832), [@vlvasilev](https://github.com/vlvasilev))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed an issue that would cause the `gardenlet` to run into `CrashLoopBackoff` when following the docs/development/getting_started_locally.md#remote-local-setup guide. ([gardener/gardener#7841](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7841), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
* *[OPERATOR]* When Seed's `spec.settings.ownerChecks.enabled=false` gardenlet is now able to delete the owner DNSRecord for a Shoot stuck in deletion where the kube-apiserver Deployment is missing but the Infrastructure is present and cannot be deleted for some reason (infrastructure dependency, invalid credentials). ([gardener/gardener#7842](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7842), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* The Istio Ingress-Gateway deployment was refined to speed up seed bootstrapping times. ([gardener/gardener#7844](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7844), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[OPERATOR]* Change `log` mount path of `node-problem-detector` from `/var/log` to `/var/log/journal`. ([gardener/gardener#7860](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7860), [@AleksandarSavchev](https://github.com/AleksandarSavchev))
* *[OPERATOR]* Gardener now deploys the [cluster-autoscaler](https://github.com/gardener/autoscaler) earlier in the shoot reconciliation flow without checking if the worker pools are ready. ([gardener/gardener#7774](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7774), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Update local-setup to `kind@v0.18.0`. ([gardener/gardener#7831](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7831), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Deactivate leader election, health and readiness checks when running `make *-debug.` ([gardener/gardener#7847](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7847), [@oliver-goetz](https://github.com/oliver-goetz))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Improves testing flakiness of logging testmachinery test by making the loki init-container reliable. ([gardener/gardener#7848](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7848), [@nickytd](https://github.com/nickytd))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Go version is updated to 1.20.4. ([gardener/gardener#7862](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7862), [@shafeeqes](https://github.com/shafeeqes))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The `register-kind2-env` and `tear-down-kind2-env` will no longer try to deploy and delete the `seed-local` `Secret`. This fixes an issue where `tear-down-kind2-env` would hang as it deletes and then waits for the `seed-local` `Secret` to be deleted which can not happen as long as the `local` `Seed` which uses it still exists. ([gardener/gardener#7742](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7742), [@plkokanov](https://github.com/plkokanov))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Introduced a new field called `machineDeploymentsLastUpdateTime` in the `Worker` status to keep track of the time when the status of the Worker resource was last updated with the latest machine deployments. ([gardener/gardener#7774](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7774), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
# [hvpa-controller]
## ✨ New Features
* *[OPERATOR]* HVPA supports k8s versions >= 1.25 by switching to `k8s.io/autoscaling/v2` when necessary for all API calls. ([gardener/hvpa-controller#121](https://github.com/gardener/hvpa-controller/pull/121), [@voelzmo](https://github.com/voelzmo))
* *[OPERATOR]* Added a LeaderElectionID to the controller options, allowing to run multiple instances of HVPA with leader election when `--leader-elect=true` is passed as commandline arg ([gardener/hvpa-controller#122](https://github.com/gardener/hvpa-controller/pull/122), [@voelzmo](https://github.com/voelzmo))
## 🏃 Others
* *[OPERATOR]* Updated go to 1.19.9 ([gardener/hvpa-controller#123](https://github.com/gardener/hvpa-controller/pull/123), [@voelzmo](https://github.com/voelzmo))
