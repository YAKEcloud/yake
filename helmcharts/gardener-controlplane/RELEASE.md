# [github.com/gardener/gardener:v1.126.0]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- `[OPERATOR]` A separate `node-local-dns` `DaemonSet` is deployed for each worker pool such that each `DaemonSet` has the name `node-local-dns-<worker-pool-name>`.  
  If you are using `gardener-extension-networking-cilium` in your landscape, it is required to update it to a version which supports these new names for the `DaemonSet`s.   
  Support is added with https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-networking-cilium/pull/622 and included in versions starting from: [`v1.42.1`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-networking-cilium/releases/tag/v1.42.1), [`v1.41.3`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-networking-cilium/releases/tag/v1.41.3) and [`v1.40.4`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-networking-cilium/releases/tag/v1.40.4) by @DockToFuture [[#12422](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12422)]
- `[OPERATOR]` ‚ö†Ô∏è The `NewWorkerPoolHash` feature gate has been promoted to beta and is now enabled by default. When the feature gate is enabled, changes to `kubeReserved`, `systemReserved`, `evictionHard` or `cpuManagerPolicy` in the `kubelet` of the `Shoot` will trigger a node-roll. All provider extensions must be upgraded to a version which includes Gardener `v1.98.0` first to support this feature. by @Duciwuci [[#12550](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12550)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The local Gardener development setup has been restructured:  
    
  - The location of key config files has changed. In particular, `project.yaml` now has to be created at `example/provider-extensions/garden/project/base/project.yaml`.  
  - The deprecated `SecretBinding` resource has been removed from the local deployment. Developers should now use `CredentialsBinding` resources instead.  
  - The template for credentials bindings is now located at:  
    - For static credentials: [`example/provider-extensions/garden/project/without-workload-identity/credentials/credentialsbindings.yaml.tmpl`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/provider-extensions/garden/project/without-workload-identity/credentials/credentialsbindings.yaml.tmpl)  
    - For workload identity: [`example/provider-extensions/garden/project/with-workload-identity/credentials/credentialsbindings.yaml.tmpl`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/provider-extensions/garden/project/with-workload-identity/credentials/credentialsbindings.yaml.tmpl)  
  - When referencing static credentials, update your configuration to use `CredentialsBinding` referencing `Secret` objects, as shown in the new template file. The previous `secretbindings.yaml` file and template have been removed.  
    
  **Action required:**  
  If you use static credentials for your local setup, update your configuration to:  
  - Use the new location for `project.yaml`.  
  - Replace any usage of `secretbindings.yaml` with `credentialsbindings.yaml` as per the new template and location.  
  - In your shoot spec, use `spec.credentialsBindingName` instead of `spec.secretBindingName` by @wpross [[#12748](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12748)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The constant `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/constants.ShootGroupViewers` has been removed, please use `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/constants.ShootSystemViewersGroupName` by @vpnachev [[#12673](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12673)]

## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[USER]` New ClusterRoleBindings are deployed in the shoot clusters, they will grant Admin and Viewer permissions that will be later leveraged by the `AdminKubeconfig` and `ViewerKubeconfig` feature of Gardener.  
  - `gardener.cloud:system:admins` - grants admin access to users that are Gardener System admins  
  - `gardener.cloud:system:viewers`- grants viewer access to users that are Gardener System viewers  
  - `gardener.cloud:project:admins` - grants admin access to users that are Gardener Project admins  
  - `gardener.cloud:project:viewers` - grants viewer access to users that are Gardener Project viewers by @vpnachev [[#12673](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12673)]

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- `[OPERATOR]` An issue causing the `plutono-datasources` ConfigMap to be reconciled by 2 ManagedResources when Seed is Garden managed by `gardener-operator` is now fixed. Occasionally, the issue was preventing successful Seed deletion. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#12798](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12798)]
