# [github.com/gardener/gardener:v1.128.0]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- `[USER]` The validation logic for `Project` resources has been changed: `.spec.description` and `.spec.purpose` fields may only contain letters, numbers and some punctuation characters. Existing projects are not affected by this change unless their description or purpose is updated. by @timuthy [[#12902](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12902)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The long time deprecated legacy `ScrapeConfig` roles in `monitoring.coreos.com` have been removed from CRD. by @oliver-goetz [[#12908](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12908)]
- `[USER]` In the Shoot API, the `.spec.kubernetes.kubelet.cpuManagerPolicy` and `.spec.provider.workers[].kubelet.cpuManagerPolicy` fields are now validated to ensure they can only be set to static or none. by @shafeeqes [[#12914](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12914)]
- `[USER]` In the Shoot API, the `.spec.kubernetes.kubelet.containerLogMaxSize` and `.spec.provider.workers[].kubelet.containerLogMaxSize` fields are now validated to ensure they contain a valid resource quantity. by @shafeeqes [[#12914](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12914)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The [`ShootVPAEnabledByDefault`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.127.0/docs/concepts/apiserver-admission-plugins.md#shootvpaenabledbydefault) admission plugin is now enabled by default for the Gardener API server. Disable this admission plugin explicitly if you don't want VPA to be enabled by default for newly created Shoots. If you already have the admission plugin enabled, you can remove the explicit enablement after upgrading to this version of Gardener as the plugin is now enabled by default. by @georgibaltiev [[#12854](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12854)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The following fields in the `CloudProfile` have been renamed:  
  - `spec.capabilities` -> `spec.machineCapabilities`  
  - `spec.MachineImages[].Versions[].capabilitySets` -> `spec.MachineImages[].Versions[].capabilityFlavors`  
  Please update your `CloudProfile`s accordingly if you are using capabilities (currently in alpha state). by @Roncossek [[#12751](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12751)]

## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[USER]` The `rotate-etcd-encryption-start` and `rotate-etcd-encryption-complete` operation annotations have been deprecated in favour of `rotate-etcd-encryption-key`. by @AleksandarSavchev [[#12605](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12605)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` Usages of the deprecated `gopkg.in/yaml.v{2|3}` packages were dropped. Please refrain from using them. Instead, please use the `go.yaml.in/yaml/v4` package instead. by @tobschli [[#12895](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12895)]

## ‚ú® New Features
- `[OPERATOR]` It is now allowed backups to use `WorkloadIdentity` as credentials via the `seed.spec.backup.credentialsRef` and `backupBucket.spec.credentialsRef` APIs. In order to make use of this feature, the infrastructure and provider extension must support `WorkloadIdentity` credentials. by @vpnachev [[#12924](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12924)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` A developer guideline on validation in Gardener extensions has been added. Please consult this document as an extension developer or reviewer to ensure consistency in validation code across the Gardener extensions codebase. Check out the [Validation Guidelines for Extensions](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.127.0/docs/extensions/validation-guidelines-for-extensions.md) document. by @ialidzhikov [[#12811](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12811)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` A developer guideline on validation in Gardener components has been added. Please consult this document as a developer or reviewer to ensure consistency in validation code across the Gardener codebase.

- `[USER]` Added operation annotation `rotate-etcd-encryption-key` which can be set to the `Shoot` and `Garden` resource to perform an etcd encryption key rotation. by @AleksandarSavchev [[#12605](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12605)]

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- `[DEPENDENCY]` The certificate issuance and renewal flow for webhooks has been improved.

- `[OPERATOR]` An issue causing the update of existing `CustomResourceDefinitions` to be no-op is now fixed. by @shafeeqes [[#12963](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12963)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in the gardenlet start-up migration of the Admin and Viewer Kubeconfig ClusterRoleBindings where a ManagedResource secret could be deleted leading to gardenlet being unable to startup is fixed. by @vpnachev [[#12923](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12923)]
