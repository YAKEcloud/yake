- `[DEVELOPER]` Add support for `Local` provider for e2e tests. by @shreyas-s-rao [gardener/etcd-druid#668]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug causing incorrect volume mount path for `Etcd`s and `EtcdCopyBackupsTask`s using `Local` snapshot storage provider while using distroless etcd-backup-restore image `v0.25.x` has been resolved. by @aaronfern [gardener/etcd-druid#662]
- `[OPERATOR]` Custodian controller no longer watches leases owned by the etcd resources, thus reducing frequency of etcd status updates and now honouring `custodian-sync-period` value. by @shreyas-s-rao [gardener/etcd-druid#688]
- `[OPERATOR]` Resolved an issue where the Custodian Controller was not updating the `Replicas` field in the `etcd` status to reflect the `CurrentReplicas` from the StatefulSet status.

- `[OPERATOR]` A bug causing `EtcdCopyBackupsTask` jobs to fail to create temp snapshot directory while using distroless etcd-backup-restore image `v0.25.x` has been resolved. by @aaronfern [gardener/etcd-druid#662]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Upgraded `etcd-backup-restore` from `v0.24.3` to `v0.24.6` for `etcd-custom-image`, and from `v0.25.1` to `v0.26.0` for `etcd-wrapper` by @gardener-robot-ci-3 [gardener/etcd-druid#687]

# [gardener/etcd-backup-restore]

## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[USER]` Introduce flag `metrics-scrape-wait-duration` to `etcdbrctl compact` command, that specifies a wait duration at the end of a snapshot compaction, to allow Prometheus to scrape metrics related to compaction before the `etcdbrctl` process exits. by @abdasgupta [gardener/etcd-backup-restore#667]
- `[OPERATOR]` Etcd-backup-restore now uses the user home directory to create files. by @aaronfern [gardener/etcd-backup-restore#637]
- `[OPERATOR]` Etcd-backup-restore now uses a distroless image as its base image. It is no longer compatible with [etcd-custom-image](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-custom-image), and must be used with [etcd-wrapper](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-wrapper) instead.  by @aaronfern [gardener/etcd-backup-restore#637]

## üèÉ Others

- `[DEVELOPER]` status.Status now captures underline cause, allowing consumers to introspect the error returned by the provider. WrapError() function could be used to wrap the provider error by @unmarshall [gardener/machine-controller-manager#842]

- `[OPERATOR]` New metrics introduced:   
  - api_request_duration_seconds -> tracks time taken for successful invocation of provider APIs. This metric can be filtered by provider and service.  
  - driver_request_duration_seconds -> tracks total time taken to successfully complete driver method invocation. This metric can be filtered by provider and operation.  
  - driver_requests_failed_total -> records total number of failed driver API requests. This metric can be filtered by provider, operations and error_code. by @unmarshall [gardener/machine-controller-manager#842]

- `[OPERATOR]` Makefile targets have changed: Introduced gardener-setup, gardener-restore, gardener-local-mcm-up, non-gardener-setup, non-gardener-restore,  non-gardener-local-mcm-up.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEPENDENCY]` Extensions have to implement the `ForceDelete` function in the actuator with the logic of forcefully deleting all the resources deployed by them. by @shafeeqes [#8414]
- `[DEPENDENCY]` The `extensions/pkg/controller.Use{TokenRequestor,ServiceAccountTokenVolumeProjection}` functions have been removed since they always return `true`. by @rfranzke [#8582]
- `[OPERATOR]` ‚ö†Ô∏è Gardener does no longer support garden, seed, or shoot clusters with Kubernetes versions < 1.24. Make sure to upgrade all existing clusters before upgrading to this Gardener version. by @shafeeqes [#8487]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `pkg/utils/gardener.IntStrPtrFromInt` function has been renamed to `IntStrPtrFromInt32` since `intstr.FromInt` is deprecated. by @rfranzke [#8579]
- `[USER]` The `alpha.kube-apiserver.scaling.shoot.gardener.cloud/class` annotation on `Shoot`s has no effect anymore and should be removed. by @rfranzke [#8526]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[USER]` The two additional labels `worker.gardener.cloud/image-name` and `worker.gardener.cloud/image-version` that were previously introduced and attached to worker nodes are removed again to fix a regression that causes the `kubelet` to restart on nodes that are due to be upgraded to a new OS but not rolled yet which causes their `Pod`s to become temporarily unready. by @MrBatschner [#8524]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `MachineControllerManagerDeployment` has been promoted to beta and is now enabled by default. Make sure that all registered provider extensions support this feature gate before upgrading to this version of Gardener. by @rfranzke [#8526]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `DisableScalingClassesForShoots` feature gates has been promoted to GA (and is now always enabled). by @rfranzke [#8526]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` When the `ShootForceDeletion` featuregate in the apiserver is turned on, users will be able to force-delete the Shoot. You **MUST** ensure that all the resources created in the IaaS account are cleaned up to prevent orphaned resources. Gardener will **NOT** delete any resources in the Shoot cloud-provider account. See [Shoot Force Deletion](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_operations.md#force-deletion) for more details. by @shafeeqes [#8414]
- `[USER]` Multiple expanders for `cluster-autoscaler` can now be specified in the `Shoot` API via the `.spec.kubernetes.clusterAutoscaler.expander` field. by @aaronfern [#8573]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed a possibility for the `migrate` phase of control plane migration to become permanently stuck if the shoot was created when the `MachineControllerManagerDeployment` feature gate is disabled, control plane migration is triggered for the shoot and the feature gate is enabled during the migration phase. by @plkokanov [#8568]
- `[USER]`  Fix an issue, where DNS lookups for non-existing pods of a StatefulSet yielded one of the existing pods even when it should not have.  by @axel7born [#8544]
- `[USER]` A bug has been fixed that prevented users without permissions to list `CustomResourceDefinition`s from interacting with the Gardener APIs when using a `kubectl` version lower than `1.27`. by @rfranzke [#8577]
- `[USER]` A bug causing unnecessary reorder of extension in `Shoot` `spec.extensions` is fixed. by @acumino [#8569]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` The shoot namespace in seeds is redeployed during the shoot migration flow to update the zones in use. by @plkokanov [#8564]
- `[OPERATOR]` `nginx-ingress-controller` image is updated to `v1.9.0`. by @shafeeqes [#8558]
- `[OPERATOR]` Add an alert for VPNHAShootNoPods when shoot in HA (high availability) mode. by @tedteng [#8506]
- `[USER]` Gardener refined the scope of the problematic webhook matcher for `endpoint` objects. Earlier, shoot clusters were assigned a constraint reporting a problem with a `failurePolocy: Fail` webhook acting on these objects. Now, only `endpoint`s in the `kube-system` and `defaults` namespaces are considered for this check. by @acumino [#8521]
# [gardener/autoscaler]

## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` unit tests framework introduced to test implemented methods of `Cloudprovider` and `Nodegroup` interface by @rishabh-11 [gardener/autoscaler#215]
- `[USER]` Gardener autoscaler now backs-off early from a node-group (i.e. machinedeployment) in case of `ResourceExhausted` error. Refer docs at `https://github.com/gardener/autoscaler/blob/machine-controller-manager-provider/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#when-does-autoscaler-backs-off-early-from-a-node-group` for details. by @himanshu-kun [gardener/autoscaler#253]

# [gardener/etcd-custom-image]

## üì∞ Noteworthy
