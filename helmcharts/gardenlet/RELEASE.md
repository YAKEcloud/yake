# [github.com/gardener/gardener:v1.127.0]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- `[OPERATOR]` The `ProjectValidator` admission plugin is now renamed to `ProjectMutator`. If you have references to the old name of the admission plugin, make sure to adapt them before upgrading to this version of Gardener. by @georgibaltiev [[#12818](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12818)]
- `[OPERATOR]` ‚ö†Ô∏è Gardener does no longer support garden, seed, or shoot clusters with Kubernetes versions <= `1.28`. Make sure to upgrade all existing clusters before upgrading to this Gardener version. by @seshachalam-yv [[#12486](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12486)]
- `[USER]` It is not allowed anymore to specify a comma ",", as well as duplicate values, within the entries of the`Shoot.spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.apiAudiences[]`. Please update your `Shoot`s accordingly. by @tobschli [[#12788](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12788)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `Priority` field for the `MachineDeployment` API is now required instead of optional. Provider extensions need to make sure that the `MachineDeployment`s they generate specify this field. by @tobschli [[#12742](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12742)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `CredentialsRotationWithoutWorkersRollout` feature gate has been promoted to GA and is enabled unconditionally. by @rfranzke [[#12857](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12857)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The GA-ed and unconditionally enabled `NewVPN` feature gates is removed. If you have references to this feature gate, clean them up before upgrading to this version of Gardener. by @ialidzhikov [[#12807](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12807)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A Project resource's `.spec.namespace` field is now validated in the storage layer. It was previously validated in the `ProjectValidator` admission plugin due to backwards-compatibility reasons. With this change, gardener-apiserver unconditionally accepts only `garden` and values with prefix `garden-` as valid Project namespaces. by @georgibaltiev [[#12784](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12784)]
- `[USER]` gardener-apiserver no longer serves the `/openapi/v2` endpoint. kubectl < 1.27 relies on this endpoint. Make sure to use kubectl 1.27+ against this version of gardener-apiserver. by @seshachalam-yv [[#12486](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12486)]
- `[USER]` The `spec.seedSelector` field in the `Shoot` API is now validated for invalid label values. by @shafeeqes [[#12708](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12708)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The following fields of resources in the `core.gardener.cloud` group are now validated for invalid label values:  
  - `spec.seedSelector` in the `CloudProfile` API  
  - `spec.deployment.seedSelector` in the `ControllerRegistration` API  
  - `scheduling.seedSelector` in the `ExposureClass` API  
    
  The following fields of resources in the `operator.gardener.cloud` group are now validated for invalid label values:  
  - `spec.virtualCluster.gardener.gardenerControllerManager.defaultProjectQuotas.projectSelector` in the `Garden` API  
    
  The following fields of resources in the `controllermanager.config.gardener.cloud` group are now validated for invalid label values:  
  - `controllers.project.quotas[].projectSelector`  
    
  The following fields of resources in the `seedmanagement.gardener.cloud` group are now validated for invalid label values:  
  - `spec.selector` in the `ManagedSeedSet` API  
    
  The following fields of resources in the `settings.gardener.cloud` group are now validated for invalid label values:  
  - `spec.projectSelector` in the `ClusterOpenIDConnectPreset` API by @shafeeqes [[#12708](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12708)]

## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[USER]` `shoot.spec.secretBindingName` field is deprecated in favour of `shoot.spec.credentialsBindingName` and will be removed after Kubernetes support for version 1.34 is dropped. Please see https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot-operations/secretbinding-to-credentialsbinding-migration. If users do not perform the migration on their own, the migration will be forced and newly created `CredentialsBinding`s will be labeled with `credentialsbinding.gardener.cloud/status=force-migrated`. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12804](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12804)]
- `[USER]` It is now forbidden to specify configuration for admission plugins that are not configurable (via `Shoot.spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.admissionPlugins[].config`) by @tobschli [[#12768](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12768)]
- `[OPERATOR]` When `gardenlet` starts up, it now checks the version skew with the `gardener-apiserver` (click [here](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/deployment/version_skew_policy/#gardenlet) for the policy document). by @rfranzke [[#12863](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12863)]
- `[OPERATOR]` On startup `gardenlet`s will configure `.spec.dns.internal` settings for its respective `Seed`. Operators should adapt their `Seed` manifests to explicitly configure internal DNS as `.spec.dns.internal` will become a mandatory configuration after release v1.129.0. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12663](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12663)]
- `[USER]` `SecretBinding` API is deprecated in favour of `CredentialsBinding` and will be removed after Kubernetes support for version 1.34 is dropped. Please see https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot-operations/secretbinding-to-credentialsbinding-migration. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12804](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12804)]

## ‚ú® New Features
- `[OPERATOR]` Enabling feature gate `OpenTelemetryCollector` will now route logs through the collector in the `Shoot` control-plane before reaching `Vali`. by @rrhubenov [[#12568](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12568)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `Seed` spec was extended to allow explicit configuration for internal DNS settings. Operators can configure these by setting `.spec.dns.internal`. The implicit configuration that involved selecting a DNS secret from the Garden cluster based on labels will be eventually removed. Operators should adapt their `Seed` manifests to explicitly configure internal DNS. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12663](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12663)]

- `[OPERATOR]` Flip the status of a set `EmergencyStopShootReconciliations` `Seed` condition from `False` to `True`. by @LucaBernstein [[#12823](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12823)]
