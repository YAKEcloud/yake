# [gardener]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* The `core.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1` API is deprecated and will be removed soon. The `core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1` API is already available since a very long time and should be used instead. ([gardener/gardener#7443](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7443), [@ary1992](https://github.com/ary1992))
* *[USER]* Support for shoot annotation `alpha.control-plane.shoot.gardener.cloud/high-availability` has been dropped. Existing shoot clusters have already been migrated to the respective `spec` fields since Gardener [v1.60.0](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases/tag/v1.60.0). Starting with this release, the annotation is not respected and the migration will not happen anymore. Please make sure to use `shoot.spec.controlPlane.highAvailability.failureTolerance: {node, zone}` instead. ([gardener/gardener#7493](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7493), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[OPERATOR]* Before upgrading to this Gardener version, `Seed`s using `.spec.dns.ingressDomain` must now finally be switched to using `.spec.ingress` and `.spec.dns.provider` (as changed with https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/3131 back in 2020). Please find more information about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/deployment/deploy_gardenlet_manually.md#kubernetes-cluster-that-should-be-registered-as-a-seed-cluster). The `.spec.dns.ingressDomain` field is deprecated since more than 2 years and will be removed in a future version. ([gardener/gardener#7515](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7515), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* Extensions which deploy components that need to be scraped by the Prometheis in the shoot namespaces need to adapt to the new `NetworkPolicy`s. For more information, read [this section](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/development/seed_network_policies.md#network-policies-for-logging--monitoring). ([gardener/gardener#7484](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7484), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* Extensions which deploy components to shoot namespaces need to adapt to the new `NetworkPolicy`s. Concretely, the following labels related to `NetworkPolicies` are deprecated and should be replaced: ([gardener/gardener#7515](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7515), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
  * `networking.gardener.cloud/to-shoot-apiserver=allowed`, replace it with `networking.resources.gardener.cloud/to-kube-apiserver-tcp-443=allowed`.
  * `networking.gardener.cloud/from-shoot-apiserver=allowed`, replace it with the label `networking.resources.gardener.cloud/to-<service-name>-tcp-<container-port>=allowed` on `kube-apiserver` pods.
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[USER]* A taint is added to all `Node` objects on registration by the `kubelet`. Gardener removes the taint once all node-critical pods are ready. This makes sure that user workload is only scheduled to nodes where all node-critical components are ready. Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/node-readiness.md) for more details. ([gardener/gardener#7406](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7406), [@timebertt](https://github.com/timebertt))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Now by default, Gardener performs health check for all the `ManagedResource`s with `.spec.class=nil` created in the shoot namespaces. Extensions using Gardener `v1.65.0` onwards can drop the health check for the MangedResource. ([gardener/gardener#7462](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7462), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Extensions can label node-critical pods that they manage with `node.gardener.cloud/critical-component=true` to ensure user workload is only scheduled to nodes where all node-critical components are ready. Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/node-readiness.md) for more details. ([gardener/gardener#7406](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7406), [@timebertt](https://github.com/timebertt))
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The `goimports-reviser` is updated to a version that properly ignores generated files. ([gardener/gardener#7492](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7492), [@vpnachev](https://github.com/vpnachev))
## üêõ Bug Fixes

  * Before this change, high availability clusters failed to be deleted while being hibernated.
* *[OPERATOR]* An issues has been fixed that caused outdated Envoy stats filters not being cleaned up in `Istio-Ingress` namespaces. ([gardener/gardener#7397](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7397), [@timuthy](https://github.com/timuthy))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The Gardener upgrade tests have been updated to use the previous minor version of Gardener instead of the latest release tag when the environment variable `GARDENER_PREVIOUS_RELEASE` is not specified. ([gardener/gardener#7491](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7491), [@seshachalam-yv](https://github.com/seshachalam-yv))

* *[DEVELOPER]* The Shoot creation integration test now saves the kubeconfig obtained from the `shoot/adminkubeconfig` to `$TM_KUBECONFIG_PATH/shoot.config`.
