## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[USER]` `ViewerKubeconfig` is no longer using solely the group `gardener.cloud:system:viewers` to grant viewer access to the shoot cluster, instead it is now granted only to Gardener system viewer users. Project Viewer users are granted viewer access to the shoot cluster via the group `gardener.cloud:project:viewers`. by @vpnachev [[#12674](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12674)]
- `[USER]` `AdminKubeconfig` is no longer using the group `system:masters` to grant admin access to the shoot cluster, instead it is now using the groups `gardener.cloud:system:admins` granted to Gardener system admins and `gardener.cloud:project:admins` granted to Gardener Project admins. by @vpnachev [[#12674](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12674)]

## ‚ú® New Features
- `[OPERATOR]` gardener-admission-controller now supports enabling the [`OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement` admission plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#ownerreferencespermissionenforcement) for the virtual kube-apiserver. Previously, it was rejecting requests from gardenlet because the `shoots/finalizers` and `backupbuckets/finalizers` subresources were not allowed. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#13059](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13059)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `OperatingSystemConfig` containerd config was enhanced to specify the [`override_path`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/cef8ce2ecb572bc8026323c0c3dfad9953b952f6/docs/hosts.md?override_path#override_path-field) option which is respected when generating the `hosts.toml` file for the respective upstream config. by @timuthy [[#13002](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13002)]

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- `[USER]` A bug causing finalizers to not be removed from `Secret`s when such are deleted and referenced by both a `CredentialsBinding` and a `SecretBinding` is fixed. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#13075](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13075)]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue that caused `Machine`s to be duplicated when being saved in the `ShootState`. This caused the `ShootState` to grow exponentially large and fail to be created. The issue could occur when there are multiple `MachineDeployments` created for the `Shoot`. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#13089](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13089)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug in the `gardenletdeployer` unable to handle backup credentials of type `WorkloadIdentity` has been fixed. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#13087](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13087)]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed the `alertmanager-garden` peer discovery service port names by @rickardsjp [[#12988](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12988)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` An issue preventing `extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Bastion`s to be listed due to missing json tags is now fixed. by @gardener-ci-robot [[#13062](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13062)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `Priority` field for the `MachineDeployment` API is optional instead of required again. by @tobschli [[#13014](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13014)]
