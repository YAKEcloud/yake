# [gardener/gardener]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[DEVELOPER]` The unused method `WithShootCredentials` have been removed from `github.com/gardener/gardener/pkg/gardenlet/operation/shoot.Builder`. by @vpnachev [#10672]
- `[DEVELOPER]` In the local development setup, the images are pushed to `garden.local.gardener.cloud:5001` instead of `localhost:5001` now. Please add `127.0.0.1 garden.local.gardener.cloud` to your `/etc/hosts`.  by @rrhubenov [#10257]
- `[OPERATOR]` Feature gate `IPv6SingleStack` has been removed. Infrastructure-specific validations will be added in parallel to the corresponding provider extensions. by @ScheererJ [#10716]
## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` ManagedSeed's `.spec.gardenlet.config.seedConfig.spec.ingress.controller.kind` field is now defaulted to `nginx` when  
  `.spec.gardenlet.config.seedConfig` or `.spec.gardenlet.config.seedConfig.spec.ingress` is nil.  
   This allows the creation of ManagedSeed without specifying the `.spec.gardenlet` field. by @RadaBDimitrova [#10655]
- `[OPERATOR]` A new `required` controller was added to `gardener-operator`. It maintains the `RequiredRuntime` condition for `Extension` resources to indicate that the extension deployment is required in the Garden-Runtime cluster. by @timuthy [#10650]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `gardener/controlplane` Helm chart has been deprecated and will be removed after `v1.135` has been released (around beginning of 2026). We urge you to switch to a [`gardener-operator`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/operator.md)-based installation. Read all about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/operator.md#migrating-an-existing-gardener-landscape-to-gardener-operator). by @rfranzke [#10706]
- `[DEVELOPER]` `.spec.gardenlet` of ManagedSeed is now a required field. This was already the case from an API perspective, enforced by validation. by @RadaBDimitrova [#10648]
- `[USER]` The `spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig` field in the `Shoot` API is deprecated and will be removed after support for Kubernetes 1.31 is dropped. by @AleksandarSavchev [#10666]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` If an admission webhook which was deployed via `Extension` resource by `gardener-operator` is deleted again, its webhook configuration in the virtual-cluster is cleaned up automatically. by @oliver-goetz [#10585]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `CloudProfile`, `Seed`, and `Shoot` APIs are now allowing to configure access restrictions (e.g., to enable "EU access"-only or similar policies). The legacy approach with the `seed.gardener.cloud/eu-access` labels is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Make sure to adapt to the new APIs. Read all about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/usage/shoot/access_restrictions.md). by @rfranzke [#10654]
- `[USER]` The viewer kubeconfigs for shoot clusters now allow the `pods/log` subresource. by @rfranzke [#10711]
- `[USER]` Service Account Managed Issuer can be now enabled for workerless shoot clusters. by @dimityrmirchev [#10689]
- `[USER]` Structured authorization configuration can now be set by creating a `ConfigMap` with the `AuthorizationConfiguration` file set in the `config.yaml` data key and referencing it (in the `Shoot` via `.spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.structuredAuthorization`, in the `Garden` via `.spec.virtualCluster.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.structuredAuthorization` for Kubernetes versions `>= v1.30`. Read all about it [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/usage/shoot/shoot_access.md#structured-authorization). by @rfranzke [#10682]
- `[USER]` Gardener reports the cluster's egress CIDRs in `Shoot.status.networking.egressCIDRs` if supported by the used provider extension. by @timebertt [#10240]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` Fix Prometheus rule `shoot-kube-proxy`. by @LucaBernstein [#10757]
- `[OPERATOR]` The TopologySpreadConstraints calculation was improved for `StatefulSet`s to always use a stable label selector. This led to issues in the past when shoots were upgraded to HA. by @timuthy [#10750]
- `[OPERATOR]` valitail version is now pinned to v2.2.15 (depends on glibc 2.32). by @ialidzhikov [#10776]
