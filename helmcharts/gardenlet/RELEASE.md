## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* An issue causing deletion of a legacy (wrongly configured) Shoot cluster to be denied because of network ranges overlapping with the default VPN network is now fixed. ([gardener/gardener#8137](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8137), [@oliver-goetz](https://github.com/oliver-goetz))
* *[OPERATOR]* Missing permissions were added for the Gardenlet service account for `Machine` objects. This fix is relevant if feature gate `MachineControllerManagerDeployment` is enabled in your landscape.

## 🏃 Others
* *[OPERATOR]* Plutono is now updated to v7.5.22 ([gardener/gardener#8100](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8100), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed flaky operator behaviour with regards to istio deployment caused by concurrent update of garden object ([gardener/gardener#8105](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8105), [@gardener-ci-robot](https://github.com/gardener-ci-robot))
* *[OPERATOR]* The `Deploying Shoot namespace in Seed` step was slightly improved.
