## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[DEVELOPER]` The Gardener reviewer groups have been refined and can be found in the [`OWNERS_ALIASES`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES) file. This will serve as the foundation for finding appropriate reviewers for the respective areas in the future. by @timuthy [[#13024](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13024)]

## ‚ú® New Features
- `[DEVELOPER]` Shoot advertised addresses are now configurable by extension components for Shoot Ingress resources. For more details, see [Shoot Advertised Addresses](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.130.0/docs/development/shoot-advertised-addresses.md). by @dnaeon [[#13043](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13043)]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-operator` now prevents deletion of the `garden` namespace in the runtime cluster while `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Garden` resources still exist. by @rfranzke [[#13101](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13101)]

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- `[OPERATOR]` The `quay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar` image is downgraded to `v1.30.9` to prevent a regression that causes Plutono dashboards to not be loaded. by @rickardsjp [[#13187](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13187)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug which deactivates topology aware routing for kube-apiservers when l7 load-balancing is not active has been fixed. by @oliver-goetz [[#13185](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13185)]
- `[USER]` Fixes an issue where connecting to the kube-apiserver via the seed ingress URL did not work when the shoot used an exposure class. by @axel7born [[#13055](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13055)]
- `[USER]` An upstream issue causing kube-proxy to log thousands of log entries per second is now mitigated by reducing the kube-proxy verbosity level when running an affected Kubernetes version in the range [1.33.0, 1.33.6). For more details, see http://issues.k8s.io/132678. by @ialidzhikov [[#13192](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13192)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` In the local setup, the hosts file entry for `garden.local.gardener.cloud` is written again upon node reboot. by @LucaBernstein [[#13132](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13132)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug has been fixed which prevented L7 load-balancing for kube-apiservers to work correctly on Seeds/Gardens where topology-aware-routing is activated. by @oliver-goetz [[#13081](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13081)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` A default `KUBECONFIG` is now set when running `make seed-{up|down}`. by @oliver-goetz [[#13071](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13071)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The testmachinery tests for control plane migration were fixed so that the checks if nodes are kept after control plane migration are executed. by @plkokanov [[#13057](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13057)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `worker-pools-operatingsystemconfig-hashes` secret is now restored in the `Shoot`'s control plane during the restore phase of control plane migration. This fixes an issue which caused node rollouts to happen during control plane migration when the `NewWorkerPoolHash` feature gate is enabled. by @plkokanov [[#13056](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13056)]
