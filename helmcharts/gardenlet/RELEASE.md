# [gardener/gardener]

## üì∞ Noteworthy

- `[OPERATOR]` The `VPAForETCD` and `VPAAndHPAForAPIServer` feature gates have been promoted to GA and locked to `true`. by @plkokanov [#10599]
- `[USER]` The limitation of having at maximum ~80 worker pools in `Shoot`s has been lifted. Much higher numbers should be possible now (concrete limit depends on the amount of configuration within the pools (e.g., labels, taints, annotations, etc.)). by @rfranzke [#10542]
## ‚ú® New Features

- `[DEVELOPER]` Add functionality for the determination of bastion VM parameters used by the extensions by @hebelsan [#10537]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardener-operator` is now capable of deploying extension controllers to the garden runtime cluster via `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension` resources.

- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenlet` now performs garbage collection of stale `Pod`s in all namespaces (except `kube-system`) in the seed cluster. by @rfranzke [#10548]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` When checking whether a `Deployment` rollout is complete, stale `Pod`s are now ignored and no longer counted. by @rfranzke [#10548]
