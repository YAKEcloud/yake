# [github.com/gardener/gardener:v1.131.0]

## üì∞ Noteworthy
- `[OPERATOR]` On startup `gardenlet`s will configure `.spec.dns.defaults` settings for its respective `Seed`. Operators should adapt their `Seed` manifests to explicitly configure default DNS as `.spec.dns.defaults` will become a mandatory configuration after release v1.131.0. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12884](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12884)]

## ‚ú® New Features
- `[OPERATOR]` `Valitail` is now replaced with an instance of `OpenTelemetry Collector`. by @rrhubenov [[#12846](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12846)]
- `[OPERATOR]` Introduced `spec.settings.loadBalancerServices.zonalIngress.enabled` in the Seed API. When disabled, zonal istio ingress gateways are removed and the global istio ingress gateway is used instead. by @cerealsnow [[#12956](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12956)]
- `[OPERATOR]` `gardenlet` now evaluates extension health conditions first when computing the conditions of a `Shoot`. by @rfranzke [[#13231](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13231)]
- `[USER]` The `KubeApiServerTooManyAuditlogFailures` alert is now sent also to the shoot owners. by @vpnachev [[#13177](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13177)]
- `[OPERATOR]` The `Seed` spec was extended to allow explicit configuration for default DNS settings. Operators can configure these by setting `.spec.dns.defaults`. The implicit configuration that involved selecting a DNS secrets from the Garden cluster based on labels will be eventually removed. Operators should adapt their `Seed` manifests to explicitly configure default DNS. by @dimityrmirchev [[#12884](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12884)]

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- `[OPERATOR]` An issue has been fixed which was preventing `gardenlet` from registering its `Gardenlet` resource when `selfUpgrade` was set in its Helm chart values. by @rfranzke [[#13241](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13241)]
- `[OPERATOR]` A bug causing gardenlet to panic during CoreDNS migration check if the Shoot is hibernated is now fixed. by @shafeeqes [[#13302](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13302)]
- `[USER]` The early access (before the cluster creation is completed) to a `Shoot` cluster via `AdminKubeconfig` credentials is restored now when dedicated groups `gardener.cloud:system:admins` and `gardener.cloud:project:admins` are used for authorization. by @vpnachev [[#13299](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/13299)]
