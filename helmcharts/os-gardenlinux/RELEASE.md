## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[USER]` The os-gardenlinux extension does no longer enable and restart the `docker` unit as part of the init OperatingSystemConfig. If you, as end user, rely on the docker unit to be enabled by default on the Node, this is a breaking change for you. In such case, you would need to enable the docker unit on your own.  
  Pay attention that [gardenlinux@1443.1+](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/releases/tag/1443.1) no longer includes the `docker` binary unit in the OS. by @Kostov6 [#221]
