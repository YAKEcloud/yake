## 🏃 Others
* *[OPERATOR]* Adds a heartbeat controller that creates and renews a `Lease` resource named `gardener-extension-heartbeat` in the namespace where the extension controller is deployed. This `Lease` resource can be used by other controllers to check if the `os-ubuntu` extension controller is running.
