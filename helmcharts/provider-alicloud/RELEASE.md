# [gardener-extension-provider-alicloud]
## üìñ Documentation
* *[DEPENDENCY]* The flags which went out-of-support in MCM v0.49.0 have been cleaned up from MCM deployment yaml. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud#595](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud/pull/595), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
## üèÉ Others
* *[OPERATOR]* The `gardener-extension-admission-alicloud` Service in the `gardener-extension-admission-alicloud` chart can now be configured to be topology-aware. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud#591](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud/pull/591), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* The admission/validation component is now adapted such that it works well in garden cluster with enabled `NetworkPolicy` protection (default since `gardener/gardener@v1.71` when garden cluster is managed by `gardener-operator`). ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud#599](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud/pull/599), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
* *[OPERATOR]* The following dependency has been updated: ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud#600](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-alicloud/pull/600), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
  * github.com/gardener/gardener 1.67.1 -> 1.70.2
# [machine-controller-manager]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[OPERATOR]* Removal of the following flags (and corresponding fields in associated structs): 'machine-creation-timeout' 'machine-drain-timeout', 'machine-pv-detach-timeout', 'machine-health-timeout=10m', 'machine-safety-apiserver-statuscheck-timeout', 'machine-safety-apiserver-statuscheck-period', 'machine-safety-orphan-vms-period', 'machine-max-evict-retries', 'node-conditions', 'bootstrap-token-auth-extra-groups', 'delete-migrated-machine-class'. The MCM no longer accepts these flags since these are options handled by the Machine Controller invoked by platform specific provider launchers. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#769](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/769), [@elankath](https://github.com/elankath))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Deletion of 'Driver.GenerateMachineClassForMigration'. Providers need to adapt to this. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#769](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/769), [@elankath](https://github.com/elankath))
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[USER]* Machine object won't turn from `Pending`  to `Running` state if `node.gardener.cloud/critical-components-not-ready` taint is there on the corresponding node. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#778](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/778), [@SimonKienzler](https://github.com/SimonKienzler))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[USER]* An edge case where all the machineSets were scaled down to zero has been dealt with. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#803](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/803), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
* *[USER]* Fix a bug in the bootstrap token creation that caused node to not be able to join the cluster due to an expired bootstrap token. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#773](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/773), [@schrodit](https://github.com/schrodit))
## üìñ Documentation
* *[DEVELOPER]* Added proposal for hot-update of resources (instance/Nic/Disk) ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#761](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/761), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
## üèÉ Others
* *[OPERATOR]* `CrashloopBackoff` machines will turn to `Running` quicker ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#806](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/806), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
* *[OPERATOR]* CVE categorization for MCM has been added. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#791](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/791), [@dkistner](https://github.com/dkistner))
* *[DEVELOPER]* The API generation now works again. Previously the API docs was generated to a location that was ignored by git and other API docs file was maintained. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#800](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/800), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Bump `k8s.io/*` dependencies to v1.26.2 ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#792](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/792), [@afritzler](https://github.com/afritzler))
