## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue that caused deployment issues with the `gardener.cloud-fast` storage class when the extension was deployed by `gardener-operator` in the garden runtime cluster. The deployment of this `StorageClass` object is now only done for AWS seeds. by @timuthy [#1239]
