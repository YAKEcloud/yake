# [gardener-extension-provider-aws]
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* The default VolumeSnapshotClass managed by `provider-aws` does now properly define this VolumeSnapshotClass as default one. Previously there was a typo in the annotation value for `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`, hence the VolumeSnapshotClass was never considered as default one by the external-snapshotter and the VolumeSnapshotClass defaulting was never working as expected. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#723](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/723), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
  * If you already deploy your own default VolumeSnapshotClass, then consider disabling provider-aws's default VolumeSnapshotClass (using the `storage.managedDefaultClass` field in the controlPlaneConfig) as having more than 1 default VolumeSnapshotClass will prevent external-snapshotter to default the `spec.volumeSnapshotClassName` of a VolumeSnapshot.
## ✨ New Features
* *[OPERATOR]* The `csi-snapshot-validation` Service deployed by the provider-aws extension and the provider-aws's `gardener-extension-provider-aws` Service can now be topology-aware (depending on the Seed setting and the Shoot HA failure tolerance type). For more details, see the [Topology-aware Traffic Routing documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.66.0/docs/usage/topology_aware_routing.md). ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#703](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/703), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* `csi-driver-node` is annotated with the `wait-for-csi-node` annotation. Gardener uses this to only schedule workload pods to a `Node` once the driver has been successfully registered with the `CSINode` object. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#716](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/716), [@SimonKienzler](https://github.com/SimonKienzler))

* *[OPERATOR]* An issue causing provider-aws to wrongly delete the `extensions.gardener.cloud:provider-aws:csi-snapshot-validation` ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding from the Seed cluster on every Shoot deletion is now fixed. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#735](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/735), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
