## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Fix a bug where the terraform-provider-azure would not properly delete shoot resource groups. The infrastructure-controller will issue an additional delete operation for the shoot's resource group. by @kon-angelo [#842]
- `[OPERATOR]` The extension will now try to delete empty resource groups on infrastructure creation after an unsuccessful terraform-apply operation.   
  A resource group may not be ready for some time after a successful create call returns. The azurerm terraform-provider on resource group does not respect that and the GET call may result in a NotFound error creating a deadlock. The extension will try to workaround this by deleting empty resource groups under the condition that this is a Create operation. by @AndreasBurger [#844]
