## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- `[OPERATOR]` With https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp/pull/283 provider-gcp migrated the volumesnapshot CRDs to a new dedicated ManagedResources. provider-gcp does now remove the ignored CRDs. by @ialidzhikov [#606]
- Before updating to this version of provider-gcp, make sure that the migration of the volumesnapshot CRDs from the `extension-controlplane-shoot` to the `extension-controlplane-shoot-crds`  ManagedResource completed. If the migration did not complete yet, GRM will interpret the removal of the CRDs as deletion and will delete the CRDs.
