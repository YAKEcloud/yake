- `[OPERATOR]` New metrics introduced:   
  - api_request_duration_seconds -> tracks time taken for successful invocation of provider APIs. This metric can be filtered by provider and service.  
  - driver_request_duration_seconds -> tracks total time taken to successfully complete driver method invocation. This metric can be filtered by provider and operation.  
  - driver_requests_failed_total -> records total number of failed driver API requests. This metric can be filtered by provider, operations and error_code. by @unmarshall [gardener/machine-controller-manager#842]
- `[OPERATOR]` Makefile targets have changed: Introduced gardener-setup, gardener-restore, gardener-local-mcm-up, non-gardener-setup, non-gardener-restore,  non-gardener-local-mcm-up. Users can also directly use the scripts which are used by these makefile targets. by @unmarshall [gardener/machine-controller-manager#852]
- `[OPERATOR]` Added `errorCode` field in the `LastOperation` struct. This should be implemented only for the `CreateMachine` call in the `triggerCreationFlow`. This field will be utilized by Cluster autoscaler to do early backoff  by @rishabh-11 [gardener/machine-controller-manager#851]

- `[DEVELOPER]` Removed dead metrics code and refactored the remaining metrics code by @himanshu-kun [gardener/machine-controller-manager#823]
