# [gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp]

## ‚ú® New Features

- `[OPERATOR]` Workload identity can be now configured so that the federated identity impersonates a GCP Service Account. by @dimityrmirchev [#973]
- `[USER]` The provider-gcp extension does now support shoot clusters with Kubernetes version 1.32. You should consider the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md) before upgrading to 1.32. by @LucaBernstein [#957]
- `[USER]` The extension now supports `Shoot`s using `WorkloadIdentity`s instead of cloud provider credentials. by @dimityrmirchev [#855]
## üêõ Bug Fixes

- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed an issue that caused deployment issues with the `gardener.cloud-fast` storage class when the extension was deployed by `gardener-operator` in the garden runtime cluster. The deployment of this `StorageClass` object is now only done for GCP seeds. by @timuthy [#982]
- `[OPERATOR]` The bug which prevented buckets' immutability to be switched off is fixed. by @renormalize [#966]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fixed a bug where removing the ProviderConfig did not remove the retention policy from the bucket. Improved deletion behavior for immutable backup objects in GCP: when immediate deletion fails due to retention restrictions, the object's CustomTime is set, enabling delayed deletion via bucket lifecycle policies. by @seshachalam-yv [#1002]

- `[OPERATOR]` Fix a bug causing the deletion of firewall rules from different shoots if the shoot names had identical prefixes by @kon-angelo [#985]
- `[OPERATOR]` Fix an issue where the filter for the listRoutes call was not applied correctly. by @kon-angelo [#953]
