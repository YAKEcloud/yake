# [machine-controller-manager]
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* `node` field is removed from machine status. controller will now depend on the node label which already was present in the machine object's metadata. If you(or your controller) are dependent on the `status.node` field of the machine object, then kindly use `node` label under `.metadata.labels` ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#745](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/745), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
* *[OPERATOR]* Removal of the following flags (and corresponding fields in associated structs): 'machine-creation-timeout' 'machine-drain-timeout', 'machine-pv-detach-timeout', 'machine-health-timeout=10m', 'machine-safety-apiserver-statuscheck-timeout', 'machine-safety-apiserver-statuscheck-period', 'machine-safety-orphan-vms-period', 'machine-max-evict-retries', 'node-conditions', 'bootstrap-token-auth-extra-groups', 'delete-migrated-machine-class'. The MCM no longer accepts these flags since these are options handled by the Machine Controller invoked by platform specific provider launchers. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#769](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/769), [@elankath](https://github.com/elankath))
* *[DEVELOPER]* Deletion of 'Driver.GenerateMachineClassForMigration'. Providers need to adapt to this. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#769](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/769), [@elankath](https://github.com/elankath))
## ✨ New Features
* *[USER]* Machine object won't turn from `Pending`  to `Running` state if `node.gardener.cloud/critical-components-not-ready` taint is there on the corresponding node. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#778](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/778), [@SimonKienzler](https://github.com/SimonKienzler))
* *[USER]* MachineDeployment would now have `Progressing` condition even when no progress Deadline is specified. This condition would never go to the reason `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` in that case. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#762](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/762), [@himanshu-kun](https://github.com/himanshu-kun))
* *[OPERATOR]* Using `kubectl get machines` will display `Node` of the corresponding machine as a column. If `-owide` flag is used then the corresponding `ProviderID` will also be displayed. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#746](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/746), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
* *[OPERATOR]* Added new short names for machine(mc), machineClass(mcc), machineDeployment(mcd), and machineSet(mcs) resources. ([gardener/machine-controller-manager#749](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager/pull/749), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
