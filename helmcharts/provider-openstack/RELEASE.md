# [gardener-extension-provider-openstack]
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
* *[OPERATOR]* With https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-openstack/pull/297 provider-openstack migrated the volumesnapshot CRDs to a new dedicated ManagedResources. provider-openstack does now remove the ignored CRDs. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-openstack#635](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-openstack/pull/635), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
  * Before updating to this version of provider-openstack, make sure that the migration of the volumesnapshot CRDs from the `extension-controlplane-shoot` to the `extension-controlplane-shoot-crds`  ManagedResource completed. If the migration did not complete yet, GRM will interpret the removal of the CRDs as deletion and will delete the CRDs.
