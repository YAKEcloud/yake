## ‚ú® New Features

## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Bumps github.com/gardener/gardener from 1.106.0 to 1.107.0. by @dependabot[bot] [#192]

- `[OPERATOR]` Bumps github.com/gardener/gardener from 1.109.0 to 1.110.0. by @dependabot[bot] [#200]
- `[OPERATOR]` Update base image from `debian11` to `debian12`. by @MartinWeindel [#230]
- `[OPERATOR]` The legacy method of providing monitoring configuration via `ConfigMap`s labeled with `extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration=monitoring` has been removed. The extension does now only uses the [new contract](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.101.1/docs/extensions/logging-and-monitoring.md#monitoring) for providing monitoring configuration. Before upgrading to this version of the extension, make sure that the deployed Gardener version supports the [new monitoring contract](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/v1.101.1/docs/extensions/logging-and-monitoring.md#monitoring). by @RadaBDimitrova [#232]
- `[OPERATOR]` Bumps github.com/gardener/gardener from 1.107.0 to 1.108.0. by @dependabot[bot] [#196]
- `[OPERATOR]` `extension-shoot-netwroking-problemdetector` no longer supports Shoots with –öubernetes version <= 1.26. by @RadaBDimitrova [#190]
- `[OPERATOR]` Bumps github.com/gardener/gardener from 1.108.0 to 1.109.0. by @dependabot[bot] [#198]
- `[OPERATOR]` The health check controller was previously checking the health of ManagedResources `extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector-controller-shoot` and `extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector-agent-shoot`. This was redundant as gardenlet already checks and reports the health of ManagedResources with class `shoot` - see https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/7462. The health check controller of the extension is adapted to check the health of ManagedResource `extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector-controller-seed`. by @RadaBDimitrova [#214]
- `[OPERATOR]` Bumps golang from 1.23.2 to 1.23.3. by @dependabot[bot] [#193]
