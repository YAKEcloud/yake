## ‚ú® New Features

- `[USER]` Containers, which do not require privilege escalations, now forbid privilege escalations explicitly. by @georgibaltiev [#276]
## üèÉ Others

- `[OPERATOR]` Extension reconciliation and `kube-apiserver` deployment mutation flows are improved to not consider hibernation status of the shoot cluster as OWA is no longer authenticating itself in-front of the `kube-apiserver` and the dead lock around issuing access tokens cannot occur anymore.   by @vpnachev [#277]
