## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- `[OPERATOR]` The name of the validating webhook configuration has been updated from `oidc-webhook-authenticator-shoot` to `oidc-webhook-authenticator` for better consistency with other resources naming. by @theoddora [[#433](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-oidc-service/pull/433)]
- `[DEVELOPER]` The `GOARCH` makefile variable has been replaced by `TARGET_PLATFORM`. by @vpnachev [[#427](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-oidc-service/pull/427)]

## ✨ New Features
- `[DEVELOPER]` Gardener extension `shoot-oidc-service` container image now can be built for multiple platforms locally via the variable `TARGET_PLATFORMS`, e.g. `make docker-images TARGET_PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64`. If the variable is unset, the container images are built for the platform `linux/<host-arch>` only. by @vpnachev [[#427](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-oidc-service/pull/427)]

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
