- `[OPERATOR]` Helm charts of extension and admission controller are published as OCI artifacts now. by @oliver-goetz [#147]
- `[OPERATOR]` Two new fields have been added to the provider config for the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension:  
  - `.auditConfig.enabled` allows users to opt in whether to enable the reconfiguration of audit rules on the shoot's nodes and to also configure `auditd` to send logs to `rsyslog`. By default this field is `true`.  
  - `.auditConfig.configMapReferenceName` is a reference to a `ConfigMap` shoot resource which contains audit configuration. This field is only taken into account if `.auditRulesConfig.enabled` is `true`. The `ConfigMap` must contain a data key `auditd` which must contain a value of type `rsyslog-relp.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Auditd`. by @plkokanov [#149]
