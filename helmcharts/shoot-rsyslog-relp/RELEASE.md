- `[OPERATOR]` The reconciliation of the `shoot-rsyslog-relp` extension no longer waits for the `extension-shoot-rsyslog-relp-shoot` `MangedResource` to be deleted during reconciliations, if the `Shoot` cluster is hibernated. The wait will still be executed when the `Shoot` is woken up to ensure that the resources deployed in the `Shoot` are removed. by @plkokanov [#93]
